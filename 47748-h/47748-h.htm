<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>We are all children of one Father, whose Works it should be our
delight to study. As the intelligent child, standing by his parent's
knee, asks explanations alike of the most simple phenomena, and of
the most profound problems; so should man, turning to his Creator,
continually ask for knowledge. Not because the profession of letters
has, in these days, become a fashion, and that the man of general
proficiency can best work out his success in worldly pursuits; but
because knowledge is a treasure which gladdens the heart, dignifies
the mind, and ennobles the soul.</p>

<p>The occupation of the mind, by the pursuit of knowledge, is of itself
a good, since it diverts from evil, and by elevating and refining the
mind, and strengthening the judgment, it fortifies us for the hour of
temptation, and surrounds us with barriers which the powers of sin
cannot successfully assail.</p>

<p>It is not contended that the mere acquisition of knowledge will
either ensure a good moral nature, or convey religious truth. But
both religion and morals will find in the diffusion of knowledge
a ground work upon which their loftier temples may discover an
acceptable foundation.</p>

<p>The man who comprehends the order of Nature, and the immutability
of Divine law, must of necessity bring himself in some degree into
accordance with that order, and under submission to the law: hence
the <i>tendency</i> of knowledge will always be found to harmonise the
fragment with the mass, and to subvert the evil to the good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>The troubles of the world have arisen from the want of knowledge,
not from the possession of it. And in proportion as man becomes an
intelligent and reflective being, he will be a better creature in
all the relations of life. If these benefits, vast and incalculable
as they are, be the real tendency and result of knowledge, why is
ignorance allowed to remain, and why is the world still distracted by
error?</p>

<p>It is because the moral and intellectual qualities of man are, like
all creations and gifts of God, the subjects of development, whose
law is progression.</p>

<p>We can aid human improvement, but we cannot unduly hasten it.
Whenever man has sprung too rapidly to a conclusion, he has alighted
upon error, and has had to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>The greatest philosophers have been those who have clung to the
demonstrative sciences, and have held that a simple truth well
ascertained, is greater than the grandest theory founded upon
questionable premises. Newton made more scientific revelations to
mankind than any other philosopher; and his discoveries have borne
the searching test of time, because he snatched at nothing, leaped
over no chasm to establish a favourite dogma; but, by the slowest
steps, and by regarding the merest trifles, as well as the highest
phenomena, he learnt to read Nature correctly. He discovered that her
atoms were letters, her blades of grass were words, her phenomena
were sentences, and her complete volume a grand poem, teaching on
every page the wisdom and the power of an Almighty Creator.</p>

<p>When he observed an apple fall to the ground, he asked the "Reason
Why;" and in answer to that enquiry, there came one of the grandest
discoveries that has ever been recorded upon the book of science.
With that discovery a flood of light burst upon the human mind,
illustrating in a far higher degree than had ever previously been
conceived, the vastness of Almighty Power.</p>

<p>Why should not each of us enquire the "Reason Why" regarding
everything that we observe? Why should we mentally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> <i>grope</i> about,
when we may <i>see</i> our way? When addressed in a foreign tongue,
we hear a number of articulated sounds, to which we can attach
no meaning; they convey nothing to the mind, make no impression
upon the in-dwelling soul. When those sounds are interpreted to
us, in a language that we can understand, they impart impressions
of joy, hope, surprise, or sorrow, because the words convey to us
<i>a meaning</i>. In like manner, if we fail to understand Nature, its
beauties, its teachings are lost. Everything speaks to us, but we
do not understand the voices. They come murmuring from the brook,
trilling from the bird, or pealing from the thunder; but though they
reach the ear of the body, they do not impress the listening spirit.</p>

<p>Every flower, every ray of light, every drop of dew, each flake of
snow, the curling smoke, the lowering cloud, the bright sun, the pale
moon, the twinkling stars, speak to us in eloquent language of the
great Hand that made them. But millions lose the grand lesson which
Nature teaches, because they can attach no meaning to what they see
or hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"The Reason Why"</span> is offered as an interpreter of many of Nature's
utterances. Great care has been taken that these interpretations may
be consistent with the latest knowledge, obtained from the highest
sources. If the author finds that his work if accepted for the good
of those who seek not only to know, but to <i>understand</i>, he will make
it his constant care to read the Book of Nature, and to add to the
pages of this volume whatever interpretations the progress of enquiry
and discovery may demand and supply.</p>

<h2>THE REASON WHY.</h2>



<hr class="hidden2" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p><a id="question_1"></a>1. <i>Why should we seek knowledge?</i></p>

<p>Because it assists us to comprehend the <i>goodness and power of God</i>.</p>

<p>And it gives us power over the circumstances and associations by
which we are surrounded: the proper exercise of this power will
greatly promote our happiness.</p>

<p><a id="question_2"></a>2. <i>Why does the possession of knowledge enable us to exercise power
over surrounding circumstances?</i></p>

<p>Knowledge enables us to understand that, in order to live healthily,
we require to breathe fresh and pure air. It also tells us that
animal and vegetable substances, undergoing decay, poison the air,
though we may not be able to see, or to smell, or otherwise discover
the existence of such poison. Knowing this, we become careful to
remove from our presence all such matters as would tend to corrupt
the atmosphere. This is only one of the countless instances in which
knowledge gives us power over surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p><a id="question_3"></a>3. <i>Name some other instances in which knowledge gives us power.</i></p>

<p>Knowledge of <i>Geography</i> and of <i>Navigation</i> enables the mariner to
guide his ship across the trackless deep, and to reach the sought-for
port, though he had never before been on its shores.</p>

<p>Knowledge of <i>Chemistry</i> enables us to separate or to combine the
various substances found in nature. Thus we obtain useful and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
precious metals from what at first appeared to be useless stones;
transparent glass from pebbles, through which no light could pass;
soap from oily substances; and gas from solid bodies.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Give instruction to a wise man, and he
will be yet wiser; teach a just man, and he will increase in
learning."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs ix.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />


<p>Knowledge of <i>Medicine</i> enables the physician to overcome the ravages
of disease, and to save suffering patients from sinking prematurely
to the grave.</p>

<p>Knowledge of <i>Anatomy</i> and of <i>Surgery</i> enables the surgeon to bind
up dangerous fractures and wounds, and to remove, even from the
internal parts of bodies, ulcers and diseased formations that would
otherwise be fatal to life.</p>

<p>Knowledge of <i>Mechanics</i> enables man to increase his power by the
construction of machines. The steam-ship crossing the ocean in
opposition to wind and tide, the railway locomotive travelling at
60 miles an hour, and the steam-hammer beating blocks of iron into
useful shapes, are evidences of the power which man acquires through
a knowledge of mechanics.</p>

<p>Knowledge of <i>Electricity</i> enables man to stand in comparative safety
amid the awful war of the elements. Lightning, the offspring of
electricity, has a tendency to strike upon lofty objects by which
it may be attracted. By its mighty powers churches or houses may be
instantly levelled with the dust. But man, knowing that electricity
is strongly attracted by particular substances, raises over lofty
buildings rods of steel communicating with bars that descend into the
ground. The lightning, rushing with indescribable force toward the
steeple, is attracted by the bar of steel, and conducted harmlessly
to the earth. Man may thus be said to take even lightning by the
hand, and to divert its destroying force by the aid of Knowledge. And
in countless other instances "Knowledge is Power."</p>

<p><a id="question_4"></a>4. <i>Why do we breathe air?</i></p>

<p>Because the air contains <i>oxygen</i>, which is necessary to life.</p>

<p><a id="question_5"></a>5. <i>Why is oxygen necessary to life?</i></p>

<p>Because it combines with the <i>carbon</i> of the blood, and forms
<i>carbonic acid gas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Be not as the horse, or as the mule, which
have no understanding: whose mouth must be held with the bit and
bridle."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm xxxii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />


<p><a id="question_6"></a>6. <i>Why is this combination necessary?</i></p>

<p>Because we are so created that the substances of our bodies are
constantly undergoing change, and this resolving of solid matter into
a gaseous form, is the plan appointed by our Creator to remove the
matter called <i>carbon</i> from our systems.</p>

<p><a id="question_7"></a>7. <i>Why do our bodies feel warm?</i></p>

<p>Because, in the union of <i>oxygen</i> and <i>carbon</i>, heat is developed.</p>

<p><a id="question_8"></a>8. <i>What is this union of oxygen and carbon called?</i></p>

<p>It is called <i>combustion</i>, which, in chemistry, means the
decomposition of substances, and the formation of new combinations,
accompanied by heat; and sometimes by light, as well as heat.</p>

<p><a id="question_9"></a>9. <i>What is formed by the union of oxygen and carbon?</i></p>

<p>Carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p><a id="question_10"></a>10. <i>What becomes of this carbonic acid gas?</i></p>

<p>It is sent out of our bodies by the compressure of the lungs, and
mingles with the air that surrounds us.</p>

<p><a id="question_11"></a>11. <i>Is this carbonic acid gas heavier or lighter than the air?</i></p>

<p>Pure carbonic acid gas is the heaviest of all the gases. That which
is sent out of the lungs is not pure, because the whole of the
air taken into the lungs at the previous inspiration has not been
deprived of its <i>oxygen</i>, and the nitrogen is returned. Therefore the
breath sent out of the lungs may be said to consist of <i>air</i>, with a
large proportion of <i>carbonic acid gas</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_12"></a>12. <i>What is the composition of air in its natural state?</i></p>

<p>It consists of <i>oxygen</i>, <i>nitrogen</i>, and <i>carbonic acid gas</i>, in the
proportions of oxygen 20 volumes, nitrogen 79 volumes, and carbonic
acid gas 1 volume. It also contains a slight trace of watery vapour.</p>

<p><a id="question_13"></a>13. <i>What is the state of the air after it has once been breathed?</i></p>

<p>It has parted with about one-sixth of its oxygen, and taken up an
equivalent of carbonic acid. And were the same air to be breathed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
six times successively, it would have parted with <i>all</i> its oxygen,
and could no longer sustain life.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"A prudent man forseeth the evil, and hideth
himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs xxvii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_14"></a>14. <i>Is the impure air sent out of the lungs lighter or heavier than
common air?</i></p>

<p>At first, being rarefied by warmth, it is <i>lighter</i>. But, if
undisturbed, it would become <i>heavier</i> as it cooled, and would
descend.</p>

<p><a id="question_15"></a>15. <i>Why is it proper to have beds raised about two feet from the
ground?</i></p>

<p>Because at night, the bed-room being closed, the breath of the
sleeper impregnates the air of the room with carbonic acid gas,
which, descending, lies in its greatest density near to the floor.</p>

<p><a id="question_16"></a>16. <i>What are the chief sources of carbonic acid gas?</i></p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom (as will be hereafter explained), the
combustion of substances composed chiefly of carbon, the breathing of
animals, and the decomposition of carbonic compounds.</p>

<p><a id="question_17"></a>17. <i>Is breathing a kind of combustion?</i></p>

<p>It is. In the breathing of animals, the burning of coals, or of
wood, or candles, &amp;c., similar changes occur. The <i>oxygen</i> of the
air combines with the <i>carbon</i> of the substance said to be burnt,
and forms <i>carbonic acid gas</i>, which unfits the air for the purposes
of either breathing or of burning, until it has been renewed by
admixture with the air.</p>

<p><a id="question_18"></a>18. <i>What is carbon?</i></p>

<p>It is one of the elementary bodies, and is very abundant throughout
nature. It abounds mostly in vegetable substances, but is also
contained in animal bodies, and in minerals. The form in which it is
most familiar to us is that of <i>charcoal</i>, which is carbon almost
pure.</p>

<p><a id="question_19"></a>19. <i>What is meant by an elementary body?</i></p>

<p>An elementary body is one of those substances in which chemistry
is unable to discover more than one constituent. For instance, the
chemist finds that water is composed of <i>oxygen</i> and <i>hydrogen</i>.
Water is therefore a <i>compound</i> body. But <i>carbon</i> consists of
<i>carbon only</i>, and therefore it is called a simple, or elementary
body.</p>

<p class="center bq">"Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so
where there is no tale-bearer, the strife ceaseth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs xxvi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_20"></a>20. <i>Why is it dangerous to burn charcoal in rooms?</i></p>

<p>Because, being composed of <i>carbon</i> that is nearly pure, its
combustion gives off a large amount of <i>carbonic acid gas</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_21"></a>21. <i>What is the effect of carbonic acid gas upon the human system?</i></p>

<p>It induces drowsiness and stupor, which, if not relieved by
ventilation, would speedily cause death.</p>

<p><a id="question_22"></a>22. <i>What is the reason that people feel drowsy in crowded rooms?</i></p>

<p>Because the large amount of carbonic acid gas given off with the
breaths of the people, makes the air poisonous and oppressive.</p>

<p><a id="question_23"></a>23. <i>What other causes of drowsiness are there?</i></p>

<p>The candles, gas, or fires that may be burning in the rooms where
people are assembled. Three candles produce as much carbonic acid gas
as one human being; and it is probable that one gas-light produces as
much carbonic acid gas as two persons.</p>

<p><a id="question_24"></a>24. <i>Have people ever been poisoned by their own breaths?</i></p>

<p>In the reign of George the Second, the Rajah of Bengal took some
English prisoners in Calcutta, and put 146 of them into a place which
was called the "Black Hole." This place was only 18 feet square by 16
feet high, and ventilation was provided for only by two small grated
windows. <i>One hundred and twenty-three of the prisoners died in the
night</i>, and most of the survivors were afterwards carried off by
putrid fevers. Many other instances have occurred, but this one is
the most remarkable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p><a id="question_25"></a>25. <i>What is oxygen?</i></p>

<p>Oxygen is one of the most widely diffused of the elementary
substances. It is a gaseous body.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Stand in awe and sin not: commune with your own
heart upon your bed and be still"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm iv.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_26"></a>26. <i>Why do persons who are walking, or riding upon horseback feel
warmer than when they are sitting still?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Because as they breathe more rapidly, the combustion of the <i>carbon</i>
in the blood is increased by the <i>oxygen</i> inhaled, and greater heat is
developed.</p>

<p><a id="question_27"></a>27. <i>Why does the fire burn more brightly when blown by a bellows?</i></p>

<p>Because it receives, with every current of air, a fresh supply of
<i>oxygen</i>, which unites with the <i>carbon</i> and <i>hydrogen</i> of the coals,
causing more rapid combustion and increased heat.</p>

<p><a id="question_28"></a>28. <i>Why does not the oxygen of the air sometimes take fire?</i></p>

<p>Because oxygen, <i>by itself</i>, is incombustible. The wick of a candle,
which retains the slightest spark, being immersed in oxygen, will
instantly burst into a brilliant flame; and even a piece of iron
wire made red-hot, and dipped in oxygen, will burn rapidly and
brilliantly. Oxygen, though non-combustible of itself, is the most
powerful <i>supporter of combustion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_29"></a>29. <i>Why do we know that oxygen will not burn of itself?</i></p>

<p>Because when we immerse a burning substance into a jar of oxygen,
it immediately burns with intense brilliancy; but directly it is
withdrawn from the oxygen, the intensity of the flame diminishes, and
the oxygen which remains is <i>unaffected</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_30"></a>30. <i>Why do we know that oxygen is necessary to our existence?</i></p>

<p>Because animals placed in any kind of gas, or in any combination of
gases, where oxygen <i>does not exist</i>, die in a very short time.</p>

<p><a id="question_31"></a>31. <i>Where is oxygen found?</i></p>

<p>It is found in the air, mixed with <i>nitrogen</i>;
 in water combined
with <i>hydrogen</i>;
 in the tissues of vegetables and animals; in our
blood; and in various compounds called, from the presence of oxygen,
<i>oxides</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_32"></a>32. <i>Why is the oxygen of the air mixed so largely with nitrogen?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>oxygen</i> in any greater proportion than that in which it is
found in the atmosphere, would be too exciting to the animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> system.
Animals placed in <i>pure oxygen</i> die in great agony from fever and
excitement, amounting to madness.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_33"></a>33. <i>What is nitrogen?</i></p>

<p>Nitrogen is an elementary body in the form of gas.</p>

<p><a id="question_34"></a>34. <i>Where is nitrogen found?</i></p>

<p>It is chiefly found in the air, of which it constitutes 79 out of
100 volumes. It may be mixed with oxygen in various proportions;
but in the atmosphere it is uniformly diffused. It is found in most
animal matter, <i>except fat and bone</i>. It is not a constituent of
the <i>vegetable acids</i>, but it is found in most of the <i>vegetable
alkalies</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_35"></a>35. <i>What are acids?</i></p>

<p>Acids are a numerous class of chemical bodies. They are generally
sour. Usually (though there are exceptions) they have a great
affinity for water, and are easily soluble therein; they unite
readily with most <i>alkalies</i>, and with the various <i>oxides</i>. All
acids are compounds of two or more substances. Acids are found in all
the kingdoms of nature.</p>

<p><a id="question_36"></a>36. <i>What are alkalies?</i></p>

<p>Alkalies are a numerous class of substances that have a great
affinity for, and readily combine with, <i>acids</i>, forming <i>salts</i>.
They exercise peculiar influence upon vegetable colours, turning
blues green, and yellows reddish brown. But they will restore the
colours of vegetable blues which have been reddened by <i>acids</i>;

and, on the other hand, the <i>acids</i> restore vegetable colours that
have been altered by the <i>alkalies</i>. Alkalies are found in all the
kingdoms of nature.</p>

<p><a id="question_37"></a>37. <i>Could animals live in nitrogen?</i></p>

<p>No; they would immediately die. But a mixture of <i>oxygen</i> and
<i>nitrogen</i>, in equal volumes, constitutes <i>nitrous oxide</i>, which
gives a pleasurable excitement to those who inhale it, causing them
to be merry, almost to insanity; it has, therefore, been called
<i>laughing gas</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_38"></a>38. <i>Why does nitrous oxide produce this effect?</i></p>

<p>Because it introduces into the body more <i>oxygen</i> than can be
consumed. It, therefore, deranges the nervous system, and being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
a powerful stimulant, gives an unnatural activity to the nervous
centres and the brain.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_39"></a>39. <i>In what proportions are the atmospheric gases found in the
blood?</i></p>

<p>The mean quantity of the gases contained in the human blood has been
found to be equal to 1-10th of its whole volume. In <i>venous</i> blood,
the average quantity of <i>carbonic acid</i> is about 1-18th, that of
<i>oxygen</i> about 1-85th, and that of <i>nitrogen</i> about 1-100th of the
volume of the blood. In <i>arterial</i> blood their quantities have been
found to be <i>carbonic acid</i> about 1-14th, <i>oxygen</i> about 1-38th, and
<i>nitrogen</i> about 1-72nd.</p>

<p><a id="question_40"></a>40. <i>Then is nitrogen taken into the blood from the air?</i></p>

<p>Such a supposition is highly improbable. It is probably derived
from <i>nitrogenised food</i>, just as <i>carbonic acid</i> is derived from
<i>carbonised food</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_41"></a>41. <i>What is venous blood?</i></p>

<p>Venous blood is that which is returning through the <i>veins</i> of the
body from the organs to which it has been circulated.</p>

<p><a id="question_42"></a>42. <i>What is arterial blood?</i></p>

<p>Arterial blood is that which is flowing from the heart through the
<i>arteries</i> to nourish the parts where those arteries are distributed.</p>

<p><a id="question_43"></a>43. <i>What is the difference between venous and arterial blood?</i></p>

<p>Venous blood contains <i>more</i> carbonic acid, and <i>less</i> oxygen and
nitrogen than arterial blood.</p>

<p><a id="question_44"></a>44. <i>Will nitrogen burn?</i></p>

<p>It will not burn, nor will it support combustion.</p>

<p><a id="question_45"></a>45. <i>What is the difference between "burning" and "supporting
combustion?"</i></p>

<p>Oxygen gas will not burn of itself, but it aids the decomposition
by fire of bodies that are combustible. It is therefore called a
<i>supporter of combustion</i>. But hydrogen gas, <i>though it burns of
itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></i> will extinguish a flame immersed in it. It is therefore said
to be a body which will <i>burn</i>, but <i>will not support combustion</i>.</p>

so is a contentious man to kindle strife."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs xxvi.</span></p>

<p><a id="question_46"></a>46. <i>What becomes of the nitrogen that is inhaled with the air?</i></p>

<p>It is thrown off with the breath, mixed with <i>carbonic acid gas</i>, and
flies away to be renewed by a fresh supply of oxygen.</p>

<p><a id="question_47"></a>47. <i>Where does nitrogen find a fresh supply of oxygen?</i></p>

<p>In the atmosphere. Nitrogen is said to possess a remarkable tendency
to <i>mix</i> with oxygen, without having a positive chemical <i>affinity</i>
for it. That is to say, neither the <i>oxygen</i> nor the <i>nitrogen</i>
undergoes any change by the union, except that of <i>admixture</i>. The
oxygen and the nitrogen still possess their own peculiar properties.
Oxygen and nitrogen are found in nearly the same proportions in all
climates, and at all altitudes.</p>

<p><a id="question_48"></a>48. <i>In combustion does any other result take place besides the union
of oxygen and carbon forming carbonic acid gas?</i></p>

<p>Yes. Usually <i>hydrogen</i> is present, which in burning unites with
<i>oxygen</i>, and forms <i>water</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p><a id="question_49"></a>49. <i>What is hydrogen?</i></p>

<p>Hydrogen is an elementary gas, and is the lightest of all known
bodies.</p>

<p><a id="question_50"></a>50. <i>Will hydrogen support animal life?</i></p>

<p>It will not. It proves speedily fatal to animals.</p>

<p><a id="question_51"></a>51. <i>Will hydrogen support combustion?</i></p>

<p>Although it will burn, yielding a feeble bluish light, it will, if
pure, extinguish a flame that may be immersed in it. Hydrogen will
therefore <i>burn</i>, but will not <i>support combustion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_52"></a>52. <i>Why will hydrogen explode, if it will not support combustion?</i></p>

<p>When hydrogen explodes it is always in combination with <i>oxygen</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
or with the common air, which contains <i>oxygen</i>. <i>Two</i> measures of
hydrogen and <i>one</i> of oxygen form a most explosive compound.</p>

<p class="center bq">"As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as
wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence
of God."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm xlvi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_53"></a>53. <i>Why does hydrogen explode, when mixed with oxygen, upon being
brought in contact with fire?</i></p>

<p>Because of its strong affinity for <i>oxygen</i>, with which, upon the
application of heat, it unites to form water.</p>

<p><a id="question_54"></a>54. <i>Where does hydrogen chiefly exist?</i></p>

<p>In the form of <i>water</i>, where it exists in combination with <i>oxygen</i>.
<i>Eleven</i> parts of hydrogen, and <i>eighty-nine</i> of oxygen, form water.</p>

<p><a id="question_55"></a>55. <i>Is hydrogen found elsewhere?</i></p>

<p>It is never found but in a state of combination; united with oxygen,
it exists in <i>water</i>;
 with nitrogen, in <i>ammonia</i>;
 with chlorine, in
<i>hydro-chloric acid</i>;
 with fluorine, in <i>hydro-fluoric acid</i>;
 and in
numerous other combinations.</p>

<p><a id="question_56"></a>56. <i>Is the gas used to illuminate our streets, hydrogen gas?</i></p>

<p>It is; but it is combined with carbon, derived from the coals from
which it is made. It is therefore called <i>carburetted hydrogen</i>,
which means <i>hydrogen</i> with <i>carbon</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_57"></a>57. <i>How is hydrogen gas obtained from coals?</i></p>

<p>It is driven out of the coals by heat, in closed vessels, which
prevent its union with <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_58"></a>58. <i>What becomes of the water which is formed by the burning of
hydrogen in oxygen?</i></p>

<p>It passes into the air in the form of watery vapour. Frequently it
condenses, and may be seen upon the walls and windows of rooms where
many lights or fires are burning. Sometimes, also, portions of it
become condensed in the globes of the glasses that are suspended over
the jets of gas. <i>A large volume of these gases forms only a very
small volume of water.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_59"></a>59. <i>What becomes of the carbonic acid gas which is produced by
combustion?</i></p>

<p>It is diffused in the air, which should be removed by adequate
ventilation.</p>

<p><a id="question_60"></a>60. <i>What proportion of carbonic acid gas is dangerous to life?</i></p>

<p>Any proportion over the natural one of 1 per cent. may be regarded
as <i>injurious</i>. But toxicologists state that <i>five per cent.</i> of
carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere is <i>dangerous</i> to life.</p>

<p><a id="question_61"></a>61. <i>What are toxicologists?</i></p>

<p>Persons who study the nature and effects of poisons and their
antidotes.</p>

<p><a id="question_62"></a>62. <i>Which kind of combustible used for lighting tends most to
vitiate the air?</i></p>

<p>Assuming all the lights to be of the same intensity, the degree
in which the substances burnt would vitiate the atmosphere may be
gathered from the number of minutes each would take to exhaust a
given quantity of air. This has been found to be: rape oil, 71
minutes; olive oil, 72; Russian tallow, 75; town tallow, 76; sperm
oil, 76; stearic acid, 77; wax candles, 79; spermaceti candles, 83;
common coal gas, 98; canal coal gas, 152. Thus it is shown that rape
oil is <i>most destructive</i> of the atmosphere, and that coal gas is the
<i>least destructive</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_63"></a>63. <i>Is an escape of hydrogen gas from a gas-pipe dangerous to life?</i></p>

<p>It is dangerous, first, by <i>inhalation</i>. There are no less than six
deaths upon record of persons who were killed by sleeping in rooms
near to which there was a leakage of gas.</p>

<p>It is dangerous, secondly, by <i>explosion</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">In 1848, an explosion of gas occurred in Albany-street,
Regent's-park, London. The gas accumulated in a shop for a very
short time only. It had been escaping from a crack in the meter
for about one hour and twenty minutes. The area of the room was
about 1,620 cubic feet. When the gas exploded, it blew out the
entire front of the premises, carried two persons through a window
into an adjoining yard, and forced another person on to the
pavement on the opposite side of the street, where she was killed.
The effect of the explosion was felt for more than a quarter of
a mile on each side of the house, and most of the windows in the
neighbourhood were shattered. The iron railings over the area of
the house directly opposite were snapped asunder; and a part of
the roof, and the back windows of another house, were carried to
a distance of from 200 to 300 yards. The pavement was torn up
for a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> length, and the damage done to 103 houses
was afterwards reported to amount to £20,000. Other serious
explosions have taken place. The explosions of "<i>coal damp</i>,"
which frequently occur in mines, are of a similar character.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_64"></a>64. <i>What proportion of hydrogen gas with atmospheric air will
explode?</i></p>

<p>According to the researches of Sir Humphrey Davy, <i>seven</i> or <i>eight</i>
parts of <i>air</i>, to <i>one</i> of <i>gas</i>, produce the greatest explosive
effect; while <i>larger</i> proportions of gas are less dangerous. A
mixture of <i>equal parts</i> of gas and air will burn, but it will not
explode. The same is the case with a mixture of <i>two</i> of <i>air</i>, or
<i>three</i> of <i>air</i>, and <i>one</i> of <i>gas</i>;
 but <i>four</i> of <i>air</i> and <i>one</i>
of <i>gas</i> begin to be explosive, and the explosive tendency increases
up to <i>seven</i> or <i>eight</i> of <i>air</i> and <i>one</i> of <i>gas</i>, after which the
increased proportion of gas diminishes the force of the explosion.</p>

<p><a id="question_65"></a>65. <i>What is the best method of preventing the explosion of gas?</i></p>

<p>Observe the rule, <i>never to approach a supposed leakage with a
light</i>. Fortunately the gas, which threatens our lives, warns us of
the danger by its pungent smell. The first thing to be done is to
open windows and doors, and to ventilate the apartment. Then turn the
gas off at the main, and wait a short time until the accumulated gas
has been dispersed.</p>

<p><a id="question_66"></a>66. <i>Does hydrogen gas rise or fall when it escapes?</i></p>

<p>Being <i>twelve times lighter than common air</i> it <i>rises</i>, and
therefore it would be better for ventilation to open the window
at the <i>top</i> than at the <i>bottom</i>. But all gases exhibit a strong
tendency to <i>diffuse themselves</i>, and therefore they do not rise or
fall in the degree that might be anticipated.</p>

<p><a id="question_67"></a>67. <i>What proportion of hydrogen in the air is dangerous to life, if
inhaled?</i></p>

<p>One-fiftieth part has been found to have a <i>serious effect</i> upon
animals. The effects it produces upon the human system are those of
depression, headache, sickness, and general prostration of the vital
powers. It is therefore advisable to observe precautions in the use
of gas.</p>

<p><a id="question_68"></a>68. <i>What proportion of gas in the air may be recognised by the
smell?</i></p>

<p>By persons of acute powers of smelling it may be recognised when
there is <i>one</i> part of <i>gas</i> in <i>five hundred parts of atmospheric
air</i>;
 but it becomes very perceptible when it forms <i>one</i> part in <i>a
hundred and fifty</i>. Warning is, therefore, given to us long before
the point of danger arrives.</p>

<p><a id="question_69"></a>69. <i>What other sources of hydrogen are there in our dwellings?</i></p>

<p>It arises from the decomposition of animal and vegetable substances,
containing <i>sulphur</i> and <i>hydrogen</i>. These give off a gas called
<i>sulphuretted hydrogen</i>, from which the fætid effluviam of drains
and water-closets chiefly arise. We should, therefore, take every
precaution to secure effective drainage, and to keep drain-traps in
proper order.</p>

<p><a id="question_70"></a>70. <i>May the use of gas for purposes of illumination be considered
highly dangerous?</i></p>

<p>Not if it is intelligently managed. The appliances for the regulation
of gas are so very simple and perfect, that accidents seldom arise
except from neglect. In England 6,000,000 tons of coal are usually
consumed in the manufacture of gas, producing 60,000,000,000 cubic
feet of gas. And yet accidents are of very uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p><a id="question_71"></a>71. <i>What is heat?</i></p>

<p>Heat is a principle in nature which, like light and electricity, is
best understood by its <i>effects</i>. We popularly call that heat, which
raises the temperature of bodies submitted to its influence.</p>

<p><a id="question_72"></a>72. <i>What is caloric?</i></p>

<p>Caloric is another term for heat. It is advisable, however, to use
the term <i>caloric</i> when speaking of the <i>cause</i> of heat, and of
<i>heat</i> as the <i>effect</i> of the presence of <i>caloric</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_73"></a>73. <i>What is the source of caloric?</i></p>

<p>The sun is its chief source. But caloric, in some degree, exists <i>in
every known substance</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_74"></a>74. <i>What are the effects of caloric?</i></p>

<p>Heat which, in proportion to its intensity, acts variously
upon all bodies, causing <i>expansion</i>, <i>fusion</i>, <i>evaporation</i>,
<i>decomposition</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_75"></a>75. <i>Why is caloric called a repulsive agent?</i></p>

<p>Because its chief effects are to <i>expand</i>, <i>fuse</i>, <i>evaporate</i>, or
<i>decompose</i> the substances upon which it acts.</p>

<p><a id="question_76"></a>76. <i>What is an attractive agent, in contradistinction to a repulsive
agent?</i></p>

<p>Chemical attraction, or affinity, is an attractive agent&mdash;as when
bodies seek of their own natures to unite and form some new body.</p>

<p><a id="question_77"></a>77. <i>When is a body said to be hot?</i></p>

<p>When it holds so much <i>caloric</i> that it diffuses heat to surrounding
objects.</p>

<p><a id="question_78"></a>78. <i>When is a body said to be cold?</i></p>

<p>When it holds less <i>caloric</i> than surrounding objects, and absorbs
heat from them.</p>

<p><a id="question_79"></a>79. <i>How may caloric be excited to develop heat?</i></p>

<p>By any means which cause agitation, or produce an active change
in the condition of bodies. Thus friction, percussion, sudden
condensation or expansion, chemical combination, and electrical
discharges, all develope <i>heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_80"></a>80. <i>Why do "burning glasses" appear to set fire to combustible
substances?</i></p>

<p>Because they gather into one point, or <i>focus</i>, several rays of
<i>caloric</i> as they are travelling from the sun, and the accumulation
of caloric developes that intensity of <i>heat</i> which constitutes
<i>fire</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_81"></a>81. <i>What is a focus?</i></p>

<p>In optics, it is the point or centre at which, or around which,
divergent rays are brought into the closest possible union.</p>

<p><a id="question_82"></a>82. <i>What is fire?</i></p>

<p>It is a violent chemical action attending the combustion of the
ingredients of <i>fuel</i> with the <i>oxygen</i> of the air.</p>

<p><a id="question_83"></a>83. <i>What are the properties of fire?</i></p>

<p>It imparts heat, which has the effect of expanding both fluids and
solids.</p>

<p>It cannot exist without the presence of combustible materials.</p>

<p>It has a tendency to diffuse itself in every direction.</p>

<p>It cannot exist without oxygen or atmospheric air.</p>

<p><a id="question_84"></a>84. <i>What elements take part in the maintenance of a fire?</i></p>

<p>Hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Hydrogen and carbon exist in the
<i>fuel</i>, and oxygen is supplied by the <i>air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_85"></a>85. <i>How does the combustion of a fire begin?</i></p>

<p>A match made of phosphorous and sulphur (highly inflammable
substances) is drawn over a piece of sand-paper; the <i>friction</i> of
the match induces the presence of <i>caloric</i>, which developes <i>heat</i>,
and ignites the match, the burning of which is sustained by the
<i>oxygen</i> of the air. The flame is then applied to paper or wood, and
the heat of the flame is sufficient to drive out <i>hydrogen gas</i>,
which unites with the <i>oxygen</i> of the air, and burns, imparting
greater heat to the <i>carbon</i> of the coals, which assumes the form of
carbonic acid gas by union with <i>oxygen</i>, and in a little while all
the conditions of <i>combustion</i> are established.</p>

<p><a id="question_86"></a>86. <i>What are the properties of heat?</i></p>

<p>It may exist without <i>fire</i> or <i>light</i>.</p>

<p>It is not sensible to <i>vision</i>.</p>

<p>It makes an impression upon our <i>feelings</i>.</p>

<p>It acts powerfully upon <i>all bodies</i>.</p>

<p>It has no <i>weight</i>.</p>

<p>It attends, or is connected with, <i>all the operations of nature</i>.</p>

<p>It radiates from <i>all bodies</i> in straight lines, and in all
<i>directions</i>.</p>

<p>It strikes most powerfully in <i>direct lines</i>.</p>

<p>Its rays may be collected into a <i>focus</i>, just as the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>It may be <i>reflected</i> from a polished surface.</p>

<p>It is more easily <i>conducted</i> by some substances than by others.</p>

<p><a id="question_87"></a>87. <i>What is animal heat?</i></p>

<p>Animal heat is derived from the slow combustion of <i>carbon</i> in the
blood of animals with the <i>oxygen</i> of the air which the animals
breathe.</p>

<p><a id="question_88"></a>88. <i>What is latent heat?</i></p>

<p>Latent heat (or more properly <i>latent caloric</i>) is that which exists,
in some degree, in all <i>bodies</i>, though it may be imperceptible to
the <i>senses</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_89"></a>89. <i>Is there latent caloric in ice, snow, water, marble, &amp;c?</i></p>

<p>Yes; there is some amount of <i>caloric</i> in all substances.</p>

<p  class="bq">A blacksmith may hammer a small piece of iron until it becomes
<i>red hot</i>. With this he may light a match, and <i>kindle the fire
of his forge</i>. The iron has become more dense by the hammering,
and it cannot again be heated to the same degree by similar
means, until it has been exposed <i>in fire</i>, to <i>a red heat</i>. Is
it not possible that, by hammering, the particles of iron have
been driven closer together, and <i>the latent heat</i> driven out?
No further hammering will force the atoms nearer, and therefore
no further heat can be developed. But when the iron has <i>again
absorbed caloric</i>, by being plunged in a fire, it is again charged
with latent heat. Indians produce <i>sparks</i> by rubbing together
<i>two pieces of wood</i>. Two pieces of ice may be rubbed together
until sufficient warmth is developed to <i>melt them both</i>. The
axles of railway carriages frequently become <i>red hot</i> from
<i>friction</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_90"></a>90. <i>Have vegetables heat?</i></p>

<p>Yes; whenever oxygen combines with carbon to form carbonic acid gas,
an extrication of heat takes place, however minute the amount. Such
a combination occurs much more extensively during the germination of
seeds and the impregnation of flowers, than at any other time. In the
germination of barley heaped in rooms, previous to being converted
into malt, it is well known that a <i>considerable amount of heat is
developed</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_91"></a>91. <i>Has any investigation of this subject ever been carefully made?</i></p>

<p>Yes. Lamarck, Senebier, and De Candolle, found the flowers of the
<i>Arum Maculatum</i>, between three and seven o'clock in the afternoon,
as much as 7 deg. Reaum. warmer than the external air. Schultz found
a difference of 4 deg. to 5 deg. between the heat of the spathe of
the <i>Canadian pinnatifolium</i> and the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> air, at six to
seven o'clock p.m. Other observations have established differences of
as much as 30 deg. between the temperature of the spathe of the <i>Arum
cordifolium</i>, and that of the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

degree, but that, under nearly all circumstances, they have a
temperature different from that of the external air, being <i>warmer in
winter, and cooler in summer</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_93"></a>93. <i>How many kinds of combustion are there?</i></p>

<p>There are <i>three</i>, viz., slow oxydation, <i>when little or no light is
evolved</i>;
 a more rapid combination, <i>when the heat is so great as to
become luminous</i>;
 and a still more energetic action, <i>when it bursts
into flame</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_94"></a>94. <i>Why does phosphorous look luminous?</i></p>

<p>Because it is undergoing slow <i>combustion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_95"></a>95. <i>Why do decayed wood, and putrifying fish, look luminous?</i></p>

<p>Because they are undergoing slow <i>combustion</i>. In these cases the
heat and light evolved are at no one time very considerable. But the
<i>total amount of heat</i>, and probably of <i>light</i>, generated through
the lengthy period of this slow oxydation, <i>amounts to exactly the
same as would be evolved during the most rapid combustion of the same
substances</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_96"></a>96. <i>What is flame?</i></p>

<p>It is gaseous matter burning at a <i>very high temperature</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_97"></a>97. <i>Why, when we put fresh coals upon a fire, do we hear the gas
escaping from the coals without taking fire?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Because, the fire being slow, the temperature is not high enough to
ignite the gas.</p>

I will show forth thy marvellous work."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm ix.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_98"></a>98. <i>What is the gas which escapes from the coals?</i></p>

<p>Carburetted hydrogen.</p>

<p><a id="question_99"></a>99. <i>Why, if we light a piece of paper, and lay it where the gas is
escaping from the coals, will it burst into flame?</i></p>

<p>Because the lighted paper gives a <i>heat sufficient</i> to ignite the
gas; and because also hydrogen requires the contact of <i>flame</i> to
ignite it.</p>

<p><a id="question_100"></a>100. <i>Why, when the coals have become heated, will the hydrogen burst
into flame?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>carbon</i> of the coals, and the <i>oxygen</i> of the air, have
begun to combine, and have greatly increased the <i>heat</i>, and have
produced a rapid combustion, <i>so nearly allied to flame</i>, that it
<i>ignites the hydrogen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_101"></a>101. <i>What temperature is required to produce flame?</i></p>

<p>That depends upon the nature of the combustible you desire to burn.
Finely divided phosphorous and phosphorated hydrogen will take fire
at a temperature of 60 deg. or 70 deg.; solid phosphorous at 140
deg.; sulphur at 500 deg.; hydrogen and carbonic oxide at 1,000 deg.
(red heat); coal gas, ether, turpentine, alcohol, tallow, and wood,
at about 2,000 deg. (incipient white heat). When once inflamed they
will <i>continue to burn</i>, and will maintain a very high temperature.</p>

<p><a id="question_102"></a>102. <i>What is smoke?</i></p>

<p>Smoke consists of small particles of <i>carbon</i> of <i>hydrogen gas</i>, and
<i>other volatile matters</i>, which are driven off by heat and carried up
the chimney.</p>

<p><a id="question_103"></a>103. <i>Is it not a waste of fuel to allow this matter to escape?</i></p>

<p>It is, as it might all be burnt up by better management.</p>

<p><a id="question_104"></a>104. <i>How may the waste be avoided?</i></p>

<p>By putting on only a little coals at a time, so that the heat of the
fire shall be sufficient to consume these volatile matters as they
escape.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_105"></a>105. <i>Why is there so little smoke when the fire is red?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>hydrogen</i> and the <i>volatile</i> parts of the <i>coal</i> have
already been driven off and consumed, and the combustion that
continues is principally caused by the <i>carbon</i> of the coals, and the
oxygen of the air.</p>

<p><a id="question_106"></a>106. <i>Will carbon, burnt in oxygen, produce flame and smoke?</i></p>

<p>It burns brightly, but it produces neither flame nor smoke.</p>

<p><a id="question_107"></a>107. <i>Why do not charcoal and coke fires give flame?</i></p>

<i>conduction</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_114"></a>114. <i>What is the Radiation of heat?</i></p>

<p>The transmission of heat by a <i>series of rays</i>. If I hold my hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
before the fire, the rays of heat fall upon it, and <i>my hand receives
the heat through radiation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_115"></a>115. <i>What is the Reflection of heat?</i></p>

<p>The reflection of heat is the <i>throwing back</i> of its rays towards the
direction whence they came. In a Dutch oven the rays of heat pass
from the fire to the oven, and are <i>reflected</i> back again by <i>the
bright surface of the tin</i>. There is, therefore, considerable economy
of heat in ovens, and other cooking utensils constructed upon this
plan.</p>

<p><a id="question_116"></a>116. <i>What is the Absorption of heat?</i></p>

<p>The absorption of heat is the taking of it up by the body to which
it is transmitted or conducted. Heat was conveyed to my hand by
<i>radiation</i>, and <i>taken up</i> by my hand by <i>absorption</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_117"></a>117. <i>What is the Convection of heat?</i></p>

<p>The convection of heat is the transmission of it <i>through</i> a body or
a number of bodies, or particles of bodies, by those substances which
<i>first received it</i>;
 as when hot water rises from the bottom of a
kettle and imparts heat to the cold water lying above it.</p>

<p><a id="question_126"></a>126. <i>Why does hot water in a metal jug feel hotter than in an
earthenware one?</i></p>

<p>Because metal, being a good conductor, <i>readily delivers heat to the

 but <i>earthenware, being an indifferent conductor</i>, parts
with the heat slowly.</p>

<p><a id="question_127"></a>127. <i>How can we ascertain that wood prevents the conduction of heat
to the hand?</i></p>

<p>By passing the top of the finger along the wooden handle of the
coffee-pot, until it reaches the point where the wood meets the
metal. The wooden handle will be found to be <i>cool</i>, but the metal
will feel <i>very hot</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_130"></a>130. <i>Why does hot metal feel hotter than heated wool, though they
may both be of the same degree of temperature?</i></p>

<p>Because metal gives out heat <i>more rapidly than wool</i>, by which it is

<p><a id="question_131"></a>131. <i>Which would become cold first&mdash;the metal or the wool?</i></p>

<p>The <i>wool</i>, because, although the metal conducts heat more rapidly,
to a substance in contact with it, it does not <i>radiate heat</i> as well
as a <i>black and rough substance</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_132"></a>132. <i>Why do iron articles feel intensely cold in winter?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_134"></a>134. <i>What is the cause of the sensation called heat?</i></p>

<p>When we feel hot, our bodies are <i>absorbing heat</i> from external
causes.</p>


<p class="bq">The condition here implied is that of health, and of ordinary
circumstances. A person in a condition of fever, suffering from
intense heat arising from a diseased state of the blood, could not
be said to be <i>absorbing heat</i>. Nor could such a description apply
to a person who, by a very rapid walk, has raised the temperature
of his body considerably above its natural state, by the <i>internal
combustion</i> which has already been described. A person feeling hot
in bed, from excessive clothes, feels hot from the <i>development of
heat internally</i>, which is not <i>conducted away</i> with sufficient
rapidity to maintain the natural temperature of the body.</p>

<p><a id="question_136"></a>136. <i>What does the hearth-stone do with the heat that it receives?</i></p>

<p>It delivers it to the surrounding air, and to any other bodies with

more from any body hotter than itself</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_137"></a>137. <i>When there is no fire in a room, what is the relative

<p>They are all of the same temperature.</p>

<p><a id="question_138"></a>138. <i>If all the articles in the room are of the same temperature,
why do some feel colder than others?</i></p>

<p>Because they differ in their relative powers of <i>conduction</i>. Those
that are the best conductors feel coldest, as they convey away the
heat of the hand most rapidly.</p>

<p class="bq">If you lay your hand upon the <i>woollen table cover</i>, or upon the
<i>sleeve of your coat</i> or mantle, it will feel <i>neither warm nor
cold</i>, under ordinary circumstances. But if you raise your hand
from the table cover, or coat, and lay it on the marble mantel
piece, the mantel-piece will feel <i>cold</i>. If now you return
your hand from the mantel-piece to the table cover or coat, <i>a
sensation of warmth will become distinctly perceptible</i>. This will

wool and marble</i>.</p>

<p>The hearth-stone, because it is a <i>good conductor</i>, and would not
only <i>receive heat</i> readily, but would <i>part with it as freely</i>
(thereby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> making its heat

<p>It would feel <i>hotter than the hearth-rug</i>, because it would part
with its heat so rapidly that it would be the <i>more perceptible</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_144"></a>144. <i>But if the hearth-stone and the hearth-rug were both colder
than the hand, which would feel the colder of the two?</i></p>

<p>Then the hearth-stone would feel the colder, because, <i>being a good

hearth-rug, which is a <i>bad conductor</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_145"></a>145. <i>Why would the hearth-stone feel comparatively hotter in the one
case, and colder in the other?</i></p>

<p>Generally speaking, <i>solids</i>, especially those of them that are dense
in their substance.</p>

<p><a id="question_147"></a>147. <i>Why are dense substances the best conductors of heat?</i></p>

<p>Because there is a considerable amount of <i>air</i> occupying the spaces
of the texture.</p>

<p><a id="question_150"></a>150. <i>Is air a good or a bad conductor?</i></p>

<p>Air is a <i>bad conductor</i>, and it chiefly transmits heat, as water

<p><a id="question_151"></a>151. <i>Is water a good or a bad conductor?</i></p>

<p>Water is an indifferent conductor, but it is a <i>better conductor than

<p><a id="question_152"></a>152. <i>Why, when we place our hands in water, which may be of the same

<p><a id="question_153"></a>153. <i>Why, when we take our hands out of water do they feel warmer?</i></p>

<p>Because the air does not abstract the heat of the hand so rapidly as
the water did, and the change in the degree of rapidity with which
the heat is abstracted <i>produces a sensation of increased warmth</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_154"></a>154. <i>Why do we see blocks of ice wrapped in thick flannel in summer

<p>Because the flannel, being a non-conductor, prevents the <i>external

<p class="bq">Flannel wrapped around a <i>warm</i> body <i>keeps in its heat</i>;
 and
wrapped around a <i>cold</i> body, prevents heat from <i>passing into

<p><a id="question_155"></a>155. <i>How do we know that air is not a good conductor of heat?</i></p>

<p>Because in heating water it <i>expands and rises</i>. The boiling of water

colder water descending to occupy its place. If the heat were not
applied at the top, it would be distributed quickly by <i>convection</i>,

<p><a id="question_164"></a>164. <i>Why is it frequently colder when a thaw takes place?</i></p>

<p>Because, in the process of thawing, a certain amount of heat is

<p>It is observed that, as winter approaches, there comes a short woolly
or downy growth, which, <i>adding to the non-conducting property of
their coats</i>, confines their animal warmth.</p>

<p class="bq">In small birds during winter, let the external colour of the
feathers be what it may, there will be found a kind of <i>black</i>
down next their bodies. Black is the <i>warmest colour</i>, and
the purpose here is to <i>keep in the heat</i>, arising from the
respiration of the animal.</p>

<p><a id="question_169"></a>169. <i>How is warmth provided for in animals that have no such coats?</i></p>

<p>They are furnished with a layer of <i>fat</i>, which lies underneath the

<p><a id="question_173"></a>173. <i>Why does perspiration cool the body?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_175"></a>175. <i>Why does air in motion feel cooler than air that is still?</i></p>

<p>Because each wave of air <i>carries away a certain portion of heat

his body raised more than two or three degrees above its natural
temperature of from 97 deg. to 100 deg.</p>

<p><a id="question_178"></a>178. <i>Why may man endure this degree of heat for a short time without

<p>Because the skin, and the vessels of fat that lie underneath it, are
bad conductors of heat.</p>

<p>And because perspiration passing from the skin and evaporating, would
<i>bear the heat away</i> as fast as it was received.</p>

influence in the preservation of living bodies from physical
influences.</p>

<p><a id="question_179"></a>179. <i>Is the air ever hot enough, in any part of the world, to
destroy life?</i></p>

<p>Yes. The hot winds of the Arabian deserts, which are called
<i>simooms</i>, scatter death and desolation in their track, withering
trees and shrubs, and burying them under waves of hot sand. When
camels see the approach of a simoom they rush to the nearest tree or
bush, or to some projecting rock, where they place their heads in an
opposite direction to that from which the wind blows, and endeavour
to escape its terrible violence. The traveller throws himself on the
ground on the lee side of the camel, and screens his head from the
fiery blast within the folds of his robe. But frequently both man and
beast <i>fall a prey to the terrible simoom</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_181"></a>181. <i>What is Radiation?</i></p>

<p>The radiation of heat is a <i>motion of the particles</i>, in a series of
rays, diverging in every direction from a heated body.</p>

<p><a id="question_182"></a>182. <i>What is this phenomena of Radiation understood to arise from?</i></p>

<p>From a strongly repulsive power, possessed by particles of heat, by
which they are excited to recede from each other with great velocity.</p>

<p><a id="question_183"></a>183. <i>What is the greatest source of Radiation?</i></p>

<p>The sun, which sends forth rays of <i>both light and heat</i> in all
directions.</p>

<p><a id="question_184"></a>184. <i>When does a body radiate heat?</i></p>

<p>When it is surrounded by a medium which is <i>a bad conductor</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_185"></a>185. <i>When we stand before a fire, does the heat reach us by

<p>By radiation.</p>

<p><a id="question_186"></a>186. <i>What becomes of the heat that is radiated from one body to
another?</i></p>

<p>It is either <i>absorbed</i> by those bodies, or transmitted through
them and passed to other bodies by <i>conduction</i>, or diffused by
<i>convection</i>, or returned by <i>reflection</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_187"></a>187. <i>How do we know that heat is diffused by radiation?</i></p>

<p>If we set a metal plate (or any other body, though metal is best for

If we turn the plate at a slight angle, and place another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> object in
a line with it, we shall find that the plate will <i>reflect the rays
it has received by radiation</i>, on to the object so placed; but if we
place an object <i>between the fire and the plate</i>, we shall find that
the rays of heat <i>will be intercepted</i>, and that the latter can no
longer <i>reflect heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_189"></a>189. <i>Why, then, if a current of air passes through a space across

<p><a id="question_192"></a>192. <i>What substances are the best radiators?</i></p>

<p>All <i>smooth</i>, <i>bright</i>, and <i>light coloured</i> surfaces are <i>bad
radiators of heat</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">Dr. Stark, of Edinburgh, has proved, by a series of experiments,
the influence which the <i>colours</i> of bodies have upon the
<i>velocity of radiation</i>. He surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> the bulb of a thermometer
successively with equal weights of <i>black</i>, <i>red</i>, and <i>white</i>
wool, and placed it in a glass tube, which was heated to the
temperature of 180 deg. by immersion in hot water. The tube was
then cooled down to 50 deg. by immersion in cold water; the
<i>black</i> cooled in 21 minutes, the <i>red</i> in 26 minutes, and the
<i>white</i> in 27 minutes.</p>

<p>You should put it into a <i>bright metal</i> jug, because, <i>being a bad
radiator,</i> it would not part readily with the heat of the water.</p>

<p><a id="question_195"></a>195. <i>Why would not the dark earthenware jug keep the water hot as
long as the bright metal one?</i></p>

<p>Because the particles of earthenware being rough, and of dark colour,

<p>It would do so, <i>if it were in contact with another conductor</i>;

but, being surrounded by air, <i>which is a bad conductor</i>, the heat

<p><a id="question_199"></a>199. <i>Why does scratching a bright metal surface increase its power

<p><a id="question_201"></a>201. <i>But if the earthenware tea-pot were set by the fire, why would

<p><a id="question_213"></a>213. <i>Why does meat become cooked more thoroughly and quickly when a

<p><a id="question_214"></a>214. <i>Why is reflected heat less intense than the primary heat?</i></p>

<p>Because it is impossible to collect all the rays, and also because a
portion of the caloric, imparting heat to the rays, is absorbed by
the air, and by the various other bodies with which the rays come in
contact.</p>

<p><a id="question_215"></a>215. <i>Can heat be reflected in any great degree of intensity?</i></p>

<p>Yes; to such a degree that inflammable matters may be ignited by it.
If a cannon ball be made red hot, and then be placed in an iron stand
between two bright reflectors, inflammable materials, placed in a
proper position to catch the reflected rays, <i>will ignite from the
heat</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">There is a curious and an exceptional fact with reference to
<i>reflected</i> heat, for which we confess that we are unable to
give "<i>The Reason Why</i>." It is found that snow, which lies near
the trunks of trees or the base of upright stones, melts before
that which is at a distance from them, though the sun may shine
equally upon both. If a blackened card is placed upon ice or snow
under the sun's rays, the frozen body underneath it will be thawed
before that which surrounds it. But if we <i>reflect</i> the sun's
rays from a metal surface, the result is <i>directly contrary</i>&mdash;the
exposed snow is the first to melt, leaving the card standing as
upon a pyramid. Snow <i>melts</i> under heat which is <i>reflected</i> from
the trees or stones while it withstands the effect of the <i>direct
solar rays</i>. In passing through a cemetery this winter (1857),
when the snow lay deep, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
were struck with the circumstance that
the snow in front of the head-stones facing the sun was completely
dissolved, and, in nearly every instance, the space on which the
snow had melted assumed a coffin-like shape. This forced itself so
much upon our attention that we remained some time to endeavour
to analyse the phenomena; and it was not until we remembered the
curious effect of <i>reflected heat</i> that we could account for it.
It is obvious that the rays falling from the upper part of the
head-stone on to the <i>foot</i> of the grave would be less powerful
than those that radiated from the <i>centre</i> of the stone to the
centre of the grave. Hence it was that the heat dissolved at the
foot of the grave only a narrow piece of snow, which widened
towards the centre, and narrowed again as it approached the foot
of the head-stone, where the lines of radiation would naturally
decrease. Such a phenomena would prove sufficient to raise
superstition in untutored minds.

<i>reflectors</i> cannot be good <i>absorbers</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_217"></a>217. <i>How do fire-screens contribute to keep rooms cool?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_220"></a>220. <i>How does the heat of the sun's rays ultimately become diffused?</i></p>

<p>It is first <i>absorbed</i> by the earth. Generally speaking, the earth
<i>absorbs</i> heat by day, and <i>radiates</i> it by night. In this way
an equilibrium of temperature is maintained, which we should not
otherwise have the advantage of.</p>

<p><a id="question_221"></a>221. <i>Does not the air derive its heat directly from the sun's rays?</i></p>

<p>Only partially. It is estimated that the air absorbs only <i>one-third</i>
of the caloric of the sun's rays&mdash;that is to say, that a ray of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
solar heat, entering our atmosphere at its most attenuated limit
(a height supposed to be about <i>fifty miles</i>), would, in passing
through the atmosphere to the earth, part with only one-third of its
calorific element.</p>

<p><a id="question_222"></a>222. <i>What becomes of the remaining two-thirds of the solar heat?</i></p>

<p>They are <i>absorbed</i> chiefly by the <i>earth</i>, the great medium of
calorific <i>absorption</i>;
 but some portions are taken up by <i>living
things</i>, both animal and vegetable. When the <i>rays of heat</i>
strike upon the earth's surface, they are passed from particle to
particle into the interior of the earth's crust. Other portions are
distributed through the air and water by <i>convection</i>, and a third
portion is thrown back into space by <i>radiation</i>. These latter
phenomena will be duly explained as we proceed.</p>

<p><a id="question_223"></a>223. <i>How do we know that heat is absorbed, and conducted into the
internal earth?</i></p>

<p>It is found that there is a given depth beneath the surface of the
globe at which an equal temperature prevails. The depth increases as
we travel south or north from the equator, and corresponds with the
shape of the earth's surface, <i>sinking under the valleys, and rising
under the hills</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_224"></a>224. <i>Why may we not understand that this internal heat of the earth
arises, as has been supposed by many philosophers, from internal
combustion?</i></p>

<p>Because recent investigations have thrown considerable and
satisfactory light upon the subject. It has been ascertained that the
internal temperature of the earth <i>increases</i> to a certain depth,
<i>one degree in every fifty feet</i>. But that below that depth the
temperature <i>begins to decline</i>, and continues to do so with every
increase of depth.</p>

<p><a id="question_225"></a>225. <i>Do plants absorb heat?</i></p>

grass, all perform a part in the grand alchemy of nature.</p>

only to our eyes. It absorbs or radiates heat, according to the
temperature of the ærial mantle that wraps alike the flower and
the man. It distills the gaseous vapours, and restores to man the
vital air on which he lives. It takes into its own substance, and
incorporates with its own frame, the carbon and the hydrogen of
which man has no immediate need. It drinks the dew-drop or the

<p>A delicate thermometer, placed among the leaves and petals of

but that the temperature varies in different plants according to
the hypothetical, or supposed requirements, of their existences and
conditions.</p>

<p><a id="question_227"></a>227. <i>What is the chief cause of variation in the temperature of

<p><a id="question_228"></a>228. <i>Why is it supposed that the colour of a flower influences its

<p>Because it is found by experiment that the <i>colours</i> of bodies bear

some analogy to the relation of <i>colours</i> to <i>light</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">If when the ground is covered with snow, pieces of woollen cloth,

laid upon the surface of the snow, near to each other, it will
be found that the relation of <i>colour</i> to temperature will be as
follows:&mdash;In a few hours the <i>black</i> cloth will have dissolved so
much of the snow beneath it, as to sink deep below the surface;
the <i>blue</i> will have proved nearly as warm as the black; the
<i>brown</i> will have dissolved less of the snow; the <i>red</i> less than
the brown; and the white the <i>least</i>, or none at all. Similar
experiments may be tried with reference to the <i>condensation

<p><a id="question_232"></a>232. <i>How is heat diffused through the atmosphere?</i></p>

<p>By <i>convection</i>. The warmth radiating from the surface of the earth
warms the air in contact with it; the air expands, and becoming
lighter, flies upwards, bearing with it the caloric which it holds,
and diffusing it in its course.</p>

<p><a id="question_233"></a>233. <i>How do the waters of the ocean become heated?</i></p>

<p>Chiefly by <i>convection</i>. Nearly all the heat which the sun sheds
upon the ocean is borne away from its surface by evaporation, or is
radiated back into the atmosphere. But the ocean gathers its heat by
<i>convection</i> from the earth. It girdles the shores of tropical lands
where, being warmed to a high degree of temperature, it sets across
the Atlantic from the Gulf of Mexico, and exercises an important
influence upon the temperature of our latitude.</p>

<p><a id="question_234"></a>234. <i>What is the cause of winds?</i></p>

<p>Currents of air, and winds, are the result of <i>convection</i>. The air,

colder air of the temperate and the frigid zones <i>blows towards the
equator</i> to supply its place.</p>

<p><a id="question_235"></a>235. <i>What is the cause of sea breezes?</i></p>

<p>Sea breezes are also the result of <i>convection</i>. The land, under the
heat of the day's sunshine, becomes of a high temperature, and the
expanded air on its surface <i>flies away towards the ocean</i>. As the
sun goes down, the earth cools again, and the air <i>flies back</i> to
find its equilibrium.</p>

<p class="bq">Many countries by the sea are subjected to these periodical
breezes, known as either "land" or "sea breezes," according to
their direction. About eight o'clock in the morning an ærial
current begins to flow from the sea towards the land, and
continues until about three o'clock in the day; then the current
takes a reverse direction, flowing from the land to the sea.
This it continues to do throughout the night, until the time of
sunrise, when a temporary calm ensues.</p>

the laws of their existence.</p>

<p>Owing, also, to this law of <i>convection</i>, the constituents of the air
are equalised. The breath of life, supplied by the purer oxygen of
the "sunny south," is diffused in salubrious gales over the wintry
climes of the north. And the waters, evaporated from the bosom of
the central Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific, are borne across vast
continents, and poured down in fertilising showers upon distant lands.</p>

consequences that govern with mighty power the material world.
Man, sitting by his fire-side, is enabled to witness the operation

Although some of these changes are imperceptible to the <i>eye</i>,
they are manifest to the educated <i>mind</i>;
 and the pleasures of
philosophical observation are as sweet as a poet's dreams.</p>

<p><a id="question_246"></a>246. <i>Why does the lower part of the flame of a candle</i> (D) <i>burn of
a blue colour?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>hydrogen</i> of the tallow, having a stronger affinity
for the <i>oxygen</i> of the air than <i>carbon</i> has, ignites first. Pure
hydrogen burns with a bluish flame.</p>

<p><a id="question_247"></a>247. <i>Why does the middle of the flame</i> (C) <i>look dark?</i></p>

<p>Because it is occupied with gaseous vapours, derived from the tallow,
which have not yet <i>ignited</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_248"></a>248. <i>Why does the upper part of the flame</i> (B) <i>produce a bright
yellow light?</i></p>

<p>Because it is in this part of the flame that the <i>hydrogen</i> of
the candle, and the <i>oxygen</i> of the air, combine, and there is
just sufficient <i>carbon</i> mixed with the <i>hydrogen</i> to improve its
<i>illuminating power</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_249"></a>249. <i>Why is there a fringe of pale light</i> (A) <i>around the upper part
of the flame?</i></p>

<p>Because some of the <i>carbon</i> escapes in a state of <i>incandesence</i>,
and as soon as it reaches the air it combines with <i>oxygen</i>, and so
forms <i>carbonic acid gas</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>
<p class="bq">If any dark body, such as the blade of a knife, be held between
the eye and the flame of the candle, so as to shut off the light
of the more luminous part, the pale fringe around the flame will
be found distinctly perceptible. <i>Incandesence</i> means <i>heated to
whiteness</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_250"></a>250. <i>Why does the flame terminate in a point?</i></p>

<p>Because cold air rushes towards the flame in every direction, and
is carried upward. At the point where the flame terminates the cold
currents have so <i>reduced the temperature</i> that combustion can no
longer be sustained.</p>

<p><a id="question_251"></a>251. <i>Why, if you hold anything immediately over the flame, will the
flame lengthen?</i></p>

<p>Because, by preventing the rapid escape of the heated air, you

of the flame.</p>

<p><a id="question_252"></a>252. <i>Why should persons whose clothes take fire, throw themselves

<p><a id="question_254"></a>254. <i>Why does pressing a flame or a spark put it out?</i></p>

<p>Because it prevents the contact of the flame or spark with the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

for combustion.</p>

<p><a id="question_259"></a>259. <i>Why does blowing sharply at a candle flame put it out?</i></p>

<p>Because the breath drives away the vapour of the grease which,
becoming gaseous, supports the flame.</p>

<p>And because too rapid a flow of cold air reduces the temperature
below the point at which combustion can be maintained.</p>

<p><a id="question_260"></a>260. <i>Why will a gentle puff of breath, if given speedily after the

re-lights it.</p>

<p><a id="question_261"></a>261. <i>Why will not a similar puff rekindle the flame of a rushlight?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_262"></a>262. <i>Why is a fire, when it is very low, sometimes put out by

<p>Because the <i>oxygen</i> of the air cannot reach the wick through the

wick.</p>

<p><a id="question_265"></a>265. <i>Why do composite and wax candles not require snuffing?</i></p>

<p>Because their wicks are made by a series of plaits, by which they are

<p><a id="question_266"></a>266. <i>Why does setting a glass upon a lamp increase its brilliancy,

<p>Because it conducts an increase of air to the flame, and the greater

rapidly consumed.</p>

<p><a id="question_267"></a>267. <i>Why does a candle burn dimly when the wick has become loaded
with carbon?</i></p>

<p>Because the carbon <i>radiates</i> the heat, and disperses it, and reduces
the heat of the flame below that temperature which is essential to
its <i>luminosity</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_268"></a>268. <i>What differences characterise the combustion of carbon and of
hydrogen?</i></p>

<p>The combustion of <i>carbon</i> takes place without the production of
flame. The charcoal (or carbon in any other form) being heated to
redness, enters directly into combination with the <i>oxygen</i> of the
surrounding air, and the carbonic acid gas, being invisible, passes
away unobserved.</p>

<p>But in the combustion of <i>hydrogen</i> the heat developed is so intense
as to render <i>the gas itself luminous</i>, just as iron may be heated to
a red or white heat.</p>

<p><a id="question_269"></a>269. <i>What has become of the candle when it has been burnt?</i></p>

<p>It has been resolved partly into <i>carbonic acid gas</i> which, though
unperceived, has diffused itself through the surrounding air; and
partly into <i>water</i>, which escaped in the form of thin vapour.</p>

<p><a id="question_270"></a>270. <i>Has any part of the candle been consumed or lost?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>No; there is no such thing as "loss" in the operations of nature.
Every particle of the candle, now invisible, exists either in the
form of <i>gas</i>, <i>vapour</i>, or <i>water</i>, with, perhaps, a few solid
particles that may be called <i>ashes</i>, but which are too minute to
excite attention.</p>

<p class="bq">The economy of nature should teach us a very impressive
lesson&mdash;<i>nothing is suffered to be wasted</i>, not even the slightest
atom. As soon as any body has fulfilled its purpose in one state

longer as a candle, is flying upon the wings of the air as
<i>carbonic acid gas</i>, and as <i>water</i>. These probably find their
way to the garden or the field, where the carbonic acid gas forms
the <i>food of the plant</i>, and the water affords it a refreshing
<i>drink</i>. And can it be supposed that the Almighty Being, who has
thus economised the existence of the <i>material</i> creation, should
be less mindful of the immaterial <i>soul</i> of man? There <i>is</i> an

<p><a id="question_271"></a>271. <i>What is coal?</i></p>

<p>Coal is a "<i>vegetable fossil</i>."</p>

<p><a id="question_272"></a>272. <i>What is meant by a vegetable fossil?</i></p>

<p>It is a substance <i>originally vegetable</i>, which, by pressure and
other agencies within the earth, has been brought to a condition
approaching that of <i>mineral</i> or earthy matter.</p>

<p><a id="question_273"></a>273. <i>Why do we know that coal is of vegetable origin?</i></p>

<p>By the <i>chemical components</i> of its substance; and also by the
<i>vegetable forms</i> that are found abundantly in coal beds.</p>
<p class="bq">Professor Buckland, in his <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>, speaking of
the impressions of plants found in the coal mines, says; "The
finest example I have ever witnessed is that of the coal mines
of Bohemia. The most elaborate imitations of living foliage upon
the painted ceilings of Italian palaces bear no comparison with
the beauteous profusion of extinct vegetable forms with which
the galleries of these instructive coal mines are overhung.
The roof is covered as with a canopy of gorgeous tapestry,
enriched with festoons of most graceful foliage, flung in wild
irregular profusion over every part of its surface. The effect
is heightened by the contrast of the coal-black colour of these
vegetables with the light ground-work of the rock to which they
are attached. The spectator feels himself transported, as if by
enchantment, into the forests of another world; he beholds trees,
of forms and characters now unknown upon the surface of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
earth, presented to his senses almost in the beauty and vigour of
their primeval life; their scaly stems and bending branches, with
their delicate apparatus of foliage, are all spread forth before
him, little impaired by the lapse of countless ages, and bearing
faithful records of extinct systems of vegetation which began
and terminated in times of which these relics are the infallible
historians."</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_274"></a>274. <i>What are the chemical components of coal?</i></p>

<p>They consist of <i>carbon</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>, <i>oxygen</i>, and <i>nitrogen</i>. The
proportions of these elements vary in different kinds of coal. Carbon
is the chief component; and the proportions may be stated to be,
generally, <i>carbon</i>, 90 per cent.; <i>hydrogen</i>, from 3 to 6 per cent.;
the other elements enter into the compound in such small proportions,
that, for all ordinary purposes, it is sufficient to say that coal
consists of <i>carbon</i> and <i>hydrogen</i>, but chiefly of <i>carbon</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_275"></a>275. <i>What is charcoal?</i></p>

<p>Charcoal consists almost entirely of <i>carbon</i>. It is made from
<i>wood</i> by the application of heat, without the admission of air. The
hydrogen and oxygen of the wood are expelled, and that which remains
is charcoal, or <i>carbon</i> in one of its purest states.</p>

<p><a id="question_276"></a>276. <i>What is animal charcoal?</i></p>

<p>Animal charcoal, like vegetable charcoal, consists of <i>carbon</i> in a
state approaching purity. It is made from the <i>bones of animals</i>,
heated in iron cylinders. It is commonly called <i>ivory black</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_277"></a>277. <i>What is the purest form of carbon known?</i></p>

<p>The purest form of <i>carbon</i> is the <i>diamond</i>, which may be said to be
absolutely pure.</p>

<p class="bq">Hence we derive another of the beautiful lessons of science&mdash;a
lesson which teaches us to <i>despise nothing that God has given</i>.
The soot which blackens the face of a chimney-sweep, and the
diamond that glistens in the crown of the monarch, consist of the
same element in merely a different atomic condition. What a lesson
of humility this teaches to Pride! The haughty beauty as she walks
the ball-room, inwardly proud of the radiance of her gems as they
rise and fall upon her breast, little thinks or knows that <i>every
breath that is expired around her wafts away the like element of
which her treasures are composed</i>. That even in our own flesh and
bones the same abounding substance lies hid; and that the buried
tree of the primitive world, and the little flower of to-day, are
both the instruments of giving this singular element to man!</p>

<p><a id="question_278"></a>278. <i>What is coke?</i></p>

<p>Coke is coal, divested of its hydrogen and other volatile parts, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a similar process to that by which charcoal is produced. It forms
the residue after hydrogen gas has been made from coals. It consists
almost entirely of <i>carbon</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_279"></a>279. <i>Why do burning coals produce yellow flame?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>hydrogen</i> which they contain is combined with some
proportion of <i>carbon</i>, which imparts a bright yellow colour to the
flames.</p>

<p><a id="question_280"></a>280. <i>Why do some of the flames of a fire appear much whiter than
others?</i></p>

<p>Because the quality of coals, and the conditions under which they are
burnt, are liable to variation. Some coals yield a <i>heavy</i> hydrogen,
called <i>bi-carburetted hydrogen</i>, which burns with a much brighter
flame than <i>carburetted hydrogen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_281"></a>281. <i>Why does bi-carburetted hydrogen burn with a whiter flame than
the common coal gas?</i></p>

<p>Because it is combined with a larger proportion of <i>carbon</i>, to which
it owes its increased luminosity.</p>

<p><a id="question_282"></a>282. <i>Why do some of the flames of a fire appear blue?</i></p>

<p>Because the hydrogen which is escaping where those flames occur is
<i>pure hydrogen</i>, destitute of carbon.</p>

<p><a id="question_283"></a>283. <i>Why does the fire sometimes appear red, and without flame?</i></p>

<p>Because the volatile gases have been driven off and consumed, and
combustion is continued by the <i>carbon</i> of the coals and the <i>oxygen</i>
of the air.</p>

<p><a id="question_284"></a>284. <i>What effect has the burning of a fire upon the composition of
the air?</i></p>

<p>It is found that in burning 10lb. of coal the oxygen contained in
1,551 cubic feet of air is altogether absorbed. It is therefore
necessary to keep the atmosphere of a room, in which a coal fire is
burning, fresh and pure, to supply 155 cubic feet of fresh air for
every pound of coal that is consumed.</p>

<p><a id="question_291"></a>291. <i>Why do fresh coals increase the quantity of smoke?</i></p>

<p>Because they contain volatile matters which are easily driven off;

matters that first escape cannot be consumed.</p>

<p><a id="question_292"></a>292. <i>Why do charcoal and coke fires burn clearly and without flame?</i></p>

<p class="bq">A new plan of kindling fires has lately been recommended. Coals
are to be laid in the <i>bottom</i> of the fire-place to a considerable
depth, then the paper and wood are to be laid on, and then a
little coals and cinders over them. This plan of "laying in" the
fire is precisely the <i>reverse</i> of that which has been pursued
for many years. The theory is, that when the coals in the bottom
are ignited, a more even combustion is kept up, whilst the smoke
and gas which would otherwise escape, and become as so much waste
fuel, is burnt up, and produces heat. We have heard the plan
strongly recommended by persons who have tried it, and who testify
to the great economy of fuel to which it conduces.</p>

<p><a id="question_294"></a>294. <i>Why does paper ignite more readily than wood?</i></p>

<p>Because its texture is less <i>dense</i> than that of wood; its particles
are therefore more <i>readily heated</i> and decomposed.</p>

<p><a id="question_295"></a>295. <i>But if articles of loose texture are bad conductors of heat,
why do they so easily ignite?</i></p>

<p>The fact that they are <i>bad conductors</i> assists their ignition.
The heat which would pass from particle to particle of the dense
substance of iron, and be <i>conducted away</i>, accumulates in the
interspaces of paper, and ignites it.</p>

<p><a id="question_296"></a>296. <i>Why does wood ignite less readily than paper?</i></p>

<p>Because its substance is <i>denser</i> than that of paper; it therefore
requires a higher degree of heat to inflame its substance.</p>

<p><a id="question_297"></a>297. <i>Why does wood, when ignited, burn longer than paper?</i></p>

<p>Because, being a denser substance, it submits a <i>larger number of
particles</i>, within a given space, to the action of the heat, and the
formation of gases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the paper is more easily ignited than wood, and wood than
coals; therefore the <i>paper</i> assists the ignition of the <i>wood</i>, and
the <i>wood</i> assists the ignition of the <i>coals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_299"></a>299. <i>Why will not wood ignite by the flame of a match?</i></p>

<p>It will do so, unless there is a great disproportion between the size
of the wood and the flame of a match. A <i>thin</i> piece of wood will
ignite, but a square block will not, because the heat of the flame
is insufficient to raise the temperature of a <i>large surface</i> to the
point that will drive out its gases.</p>

<p><a id="question_300"></a>300. <i>Why do we place the paper under the wood, and the wood under

<p><a id="question_301"></a>301. <i>Would it be possible to light the coals by putting the paper

<p><a id="question_302"></a>302. <i>Why does a poker laid across the top of a dull fire revive it?</i></p>

<p>Because the poker <i>radiates</i> the heat it receives from the fire
downward upon the fuel.</p>

<p>Because, also, it divides the ascending air, and thereby <i>creates
currents</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">The amount of good which the poker does to the fire is very slight

or brushes away the ashes that prevent the influx of air. She then
places the poker upon the top, and the popular mind supposes that
the poker "draws" the fire. The custom of placing a poker over
the fire is of very remote antiquity. It was once believed that
forming <i>a cross</i>, by placing the poker over the bars, protected
the fire from the hostility of malignant <i>witches</i>!</p>

<p><a id="question_304"></a>304. <i>Why, if a piece of paper be laid with its flat surface upon the

<p>Because, as in the case of the proper candle-extinguisher, the
<i>carbonic acid gas</i> accumulating beneath it prevents its igniting.</p>

<p><a id="question_305"></a>305. <i>Why, if you direct a current of air towards the paper, will it
burst into a blaze?</i></p>

<p>Because the carbonic acid gas is displaced by a current of air
containing <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_306"></a>306. <i>Why does water extinguish fire?</i></p>

<p>Because it <i>saturates the fuel</i>, and prevents the gases thereof from

<p><a id="question_307"></a>307. <i>As water contains oxygen, why does not the oxygen of the
water support the fire?</i></p>

<p>Because the affinity between the <i>hydrogen</i> and <i>oxygen</i> of the water
is so strong that fire cannot separate them.</p>

<p class="bq">Water may be decomposed by <i>heat</i>, as will be hereafter explained.
But the heat of an ordinary fire is insufficient. There is,
however, some reason for believing that, in cases of very large
fires, such as the accidental burning of houses, &amp;c., when the
supply of water thrown upon the fire is very deficient, the water
<i>does</i> become <i>decomposed</i>, and add to the fury of the flames.</p>

<p><a id="question_308"></a>308. <i>Why does the blacksmith sprinkle water upon the coals of his

<p>The blacksmith uses <i>small coals</i> because the small pieces thereof
are more easily ignited than large lumps would be, and they convey
heat better by completely surrounding the articles put into the fire.
He sprinkles water on the coal dust <i>to hold its particles together

hot hair drives the vapour of the water away, and leaves a porous

<p><a id="question_311"></a>311. <i>What is Spontaneous Combustion?</i></p>

<p>Spontaneous combustion is that which occurs in various bodies when
they become highly heated by <i>chemical changes</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_312"></a>312. <i>Why is heat developed during chemical changes?</i></p>

<p>Because, as all bodies contain <i>latent caloric</i>, the disturbance
of the atoms of which those bodies are composed, during the new
combinations that constitute <i>chemical changes</i>, frequently sets the
caloric free, and an <i>accumulation of caloric</i> produces spontaneous
combustion.</p>

<p><a id="question_313"></a>313. <i>Does a match ignite spontaneously when drawn over a rough
surface?</i></p>

<p>No. Because in this case the combustion arises from heat <i>applied by
friction</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_314"></a>314. <i>Does phosphorous ignite spontaneously when held in a warm hand?</i></p>

<p>Phosphorous will ignite when held in a warm hand, but it does not
then produce spontaneous combustion, because it ignites through the
agency of <i>applied heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_315"></a>315. <i>But if a piece of dry phosphorous be sprinkled with powdered
charcoal it will ignite, without the application of heat. Why is
this?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>carbon</i> (charcoal) absorbs <i>oxygen</i> from the air, and
conveys it to the <i>phosphorous</i>. Here are <i>chemical changes</i> which
develope heat, and produce <i>spontaneous combustion</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_316"></a>316. <i>Why do hay-stacks sometimes take fire?</i></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> which
heat is evolved. Hay, taking fire under these circumstances, would
exhibit <i>spontaneous combustion</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_317"></a>317. <i>What substances are liable to produce spontaneous combustion?</i></p>

<p>All substances which contain sugar, starch, and other components
liable to <i>fermentation</i>. All bodies that evolve, under low degrees
of temperature, <i>inflammable gases</i>. And all organic bodies
undergoing decay.</p>

<p class="bq">Grain, cotton, hemp, flax, coals, oily and greasy substances.</p>

<p><a id="question_318"></a>318. <i>What is the Ignis Fatuus (sometimes called "Will-o'-the-Wisp",
"Corpse Candles," and "Jack-o'-Lantern")?</i></p>

<p>It is a flame produced by spontaneous combustion, caused by the decay
of animal or vegetable bodies, which evolve <i>phosphoretted hydrogen</i>
gas, under circumstances attended by a low degree of heat, sufficient
to ignite the gases. It is mostly seen over marshy places, and
burial-grounds.</p>

<p class="bq">Many a "Ghost Story" has owed its origin to these singular but
harmless appearances. People, ignorant of the cause, have been
terrified at the effect. To the fancy of an affrighted mortal,
the simple flame of the <i>Ignis Fatuus</i> has assumed the form of
a departed friend, and even found a supernatural voice. If,
excited by a momentary daring, the beholder moved towards the
light upon which he gazed, it fled from him. If he turned from
it and walked away, it followed him, step by step. The darkness
of a lonely road, or the sacred solitude of a burial-place, have
been sufficient accessories to authenticate the appearance of a
spirit. And yet how simple the phenomenon? Matters so volatile as
those which produce the <i>Ignis Fatuus</i> would naturally be driven
back by the motion in the air caused by an advancing body; and, on
the other hand, a body moving from them would create a current in
which the <i>Ignis Fatuus</i> would follow. Poisonous gases, escaping
from decaying bodies, pass into the air and take fire. They are
thereby converted into harmless compounds. Thus we see that the
"ghost" which terrifies the mind of the ignorant, becomes a
"guardian angel" to the educated.</p>

<p><a id="question_319"></a>319. <i>Has spontaneous combustion ever occurred in living bodies?</i></p>

<p>It has occurred in numerous instances to persons habituated to the
excessive use of spirits.</p>

<p><a id="question_320"></a>320. <i>Why should spontaneous combustion occur in the case of the
drunkard?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Because spirituous drinks contain a large proportion of ALCOHOL, one
of the constituents of which is <i>hydrogen</i>. The vital energies of
the drunkard, being destroyed by excess, chemical agencies obtain an
ascendancy, and it is supposed that the <i>hydrogen</i> of the alcohol
combines with the <i>phosphorous</i> of the body to form <i>phosphoretted
hydrogen</i>, which ignites spontaneously, and literally consumes the
living temple.</p>

<p class="bq">Cases of spontaneous combustion are of rare occurrence. But they
are sufficiently well authenticated by high medical authority,
in many parts of the world, to present an awful warning to
the inveterate drunkard. The cases of which we have read the
particulars present details of the most appalling description. How
signally the Almighty displeasure at intemperance is expressed,
when the very drink which imparts the mad pleasure of intoxication
is made the <i>direct</i> instrument by which the drunkard is destroyed!</p>

<p><a id="question_321"></a>321. <i>Why does friction produce heat?</i></p>

<p>Because all bodies contain <i>latent heat</i>, that is, heat that lies hid

<p><a id="question_322"></a>322. <i>Why does the rubbing of two surfaces together attract latent

<p><a id="question_323"></a>323. <i>What are the sources of heat?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_324"></a>324. <i>Why does water freeze?</i></p>

<p>Because its latent heat is partly <i>drawn off</i> by the surrounding air.</p>

<p><a id="question_325"></a>325. <i>Why does ice melt?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_326"></a>326. <i>Why does water become steam?</i></p>

<p>Because a larger amount of heat has entered into it than can remain
latent in water. The water therefore expands and rises in the form of
vapour, or <i>water attenuated by heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_327"></a>327. <i>How many degrees of heat are latent, or hidden, in the
different states of water?</i></p>

<p>In thawing <i>ice</i>, 140 deg. of caloric become latent; and in
converting the water into steam, 1,000 deg. more of caloric are be
taken up. Therefore, <i>ice</i> requires to take up 1,140 deg. of latent
caloric before it becomes steam.</p>

<p><a id="question_328"></a>328. <i>What is the most modern theory of heat?</i></p>

<p>It is this&mdash;that caloric, which produces heat, is an extremely
<i>subtile fluid</i>, of so refined a nature that it possesses no weight,
yet is capable of diffusing itself among the particles of the most
solid bodies.</p>

<p>It is also believed that&mdash;all bodies are subject to the action of two
opposing forces: one, the <i>mutual attraction</i> of their <i>particles</i>;

the other, the <i>repulsive force</i> of <i>caloric</i>&mdash;and that bodies exist
in the <i>æriform</i>, <i>fluid</i>, or <i>solid state</i>, <i>according to the
predominance of either the one or the other of these opposing forces</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_329"></a>329. <i>How do we measure the quantity of caloric in any substance?</i></p>

<p>It is impossible to determine the amount of caloric which any body
contains. Our <i>sensations</i> would obviously be deceptive, since, if
we dipped the right hand in snow, and held the left hand before the
fire, and then immersed both hands in cold water, the water would
feel <i>warm</i> to the <i>right hand</i> and <i>cold</i> to the <i>left hand</i>.</p>

<p>But, as <i>caloric</i> uniformly expands substances that are under its
influence, one of the bodies most sensitive to <i>calorific</i> effects
has been selected to be the <i>indicator</i> of the amount of <i>caloric</i>.
This substance is <i>quicksilver</i>;
 and the scale of measurement, and
the apparatus for exhibiting the rise or fall of the quicksilver,
constitute the <i>thermometer</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_330"></a>330. <i>If it is impossible to measure the amount of caloric in any
substance, how can it be said that ice absorbs</i> 140. <i>deg. in becoming
water?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Those figures simply record the amount of calorie indicated by the
<i>thermometer</i>. The instrument will show with sufficient accuracy the
<i>relative amount</i> of caloric in various bodies, or in the same bodies
<i>under different circumstances</i>, but it can never determine the
<i>precise amount of caloric</i> in any one body.</p>

<p><a id="question_331"></a>331. <i>Why, if a hot and a cold body were placed near to each other,
would the cold one become warmer, and the hot one cooler?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>free caloric</i> (that is, caloric that is not latent,) always
exhibits a tendency to establish an <i>equilibrium</i>. If twenty bodies,
of different temperatures, were placed in the same atmosphere, they
would <i>all soon arrive at the same temperature</i>. The caloric would
leave the bodies of those of the <i>highest</i>, and find its way to those
of the <i>lowest</i> temperature.</p>

<p><a id="question_332"></a>332. <i>How does caloric travel?</i></p>

<p>It travels in <i>parallel rays</i> in all directions with a velocity
approximating to that of light; and it passes through various bodies
with a rapidity proportionate to their power of <i>conduction</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_333"></a>333. <i>Why does melted metal run like a stream of fluid?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>caloric</i> has passed into its substance, and, repelling its

<p><a id="question_334"></a>334. <i>How do we know that it is caloric passing into the substance of
the metal which produces this effect?</i></p>

<p>Because, as soon as a bar of metal begins to be heated, it <i>expands</i>
and <i>lengthens</i>. It continues to do so, until the heat arrives at
that point which <i>causes the metal to melt</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_335"></a>335. <i>Why does the iron of an ironing-box sometimes become too large
for the box to receive it?</i></p>

<i>repelled its particles</i>, by which it has become expanded.</p>

<p><a id="question_336"></a>336. <i>Why does the iron enter the box when it has become partially
cooled?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Because a portion of the caloric has left the iron, the particles of
which have <i>drawn closer together</i>, and contracted the mass.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">This effect is frequently observed by females in domestic life,
who, when they are ironing, or using the Italian irons, find that
the heated metal has been too much expanded to enter the box or
tube. They find it necessary to wait until the cooling of the iron
has had the effect of reducing its dimensions. The expansion of
bodies by heat is one of the grandest and most important laws of
nature. We are indebted to it for some of the most beautiful, as
well as the most awful, phenomena. And science has gained some of
its mightiest conquests through its aid. Yet frequently, though
quite unthought of, in the hands of the humble laundress, will
be found a most striking illustration of this wonderful force of
caloric.</p>

<p><a id="question_337"></a>337. <i>Are there any instances in which the abstraction of latent heat
will reduce the hulk of bodies?</i></p>

<p>Yes, there are several. But the most familiar one is that which is
exhibited by mixing a <i>pint</i> of the <i>oil of vitriol</i> with a <i>pint</i>
of <i>water</i>. <i>A considerable amount of heat will be evolved</i>;
 and it
will be found that the two pints of fluid <i>will not afterwards fill a
quart measure</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_338"></a>338. <i>Is there any latent heat in air?</i></p>

<p>Yes: a considerable amount. In a pint measure of air, though in no
way evident to our perceptions, there lurks sufficient caloric to
raise a piece of metal several inches square to glowing redness.</p>

<p><a id="question_339"></a>339. <i>How do we know that caloric exists in the air?</i></p>

<p>It has been positively demonstrated by the invention of a small
condensing syringe, by which, through the rapid compression of a
small volume of air, a spark is emitted which ignites a piece of
prepared tinder.</p>

<p><a id="question_340"></a>340. <i>What is the cause of the spark when a horse's shoe strikes
against a stone?</i></p>

<p>The <i>latent heat</i> of the iron or the stone is set free by the
<i>violent percussion</i>. The same effect takes place when <i>flint</i>
strikes against <i>steel</i>, as in the old method of obtaining a light
with the aid of the tinder-box.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="bq">What an eloquent lecture might be delivered upon the old-fashioned
tinder-box, illustrated by the one experiment of "striking a
light." In that box lie, cold and motionless, the Flint and Steel,
rude in form and crude in substance. And yet, within the breast of
each, there lies a spark of that grand element
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> which influences
every atom of the universe; a spark which could invoke the fierce
agents of destruction to wrap their blasting flames around a
stately forest, or a crowded city, and sweep it from the face of
the world; or which might kindle the genial blaze upon the homely
hearth, and shed a radiant glow upon a group of smiling faces; a
spark such as that which rises with the curling smoke from the
village blackmith's forge&mdash;or that which leaps with terrific wrath
from the troubled breast of a Vesuvius. And then the tinder&mdash;the
cotton&mdash;the carbon: What a tale might be told of the cotton-field
where it grew, of the black slave who plucked it, of the white
toiler who spun it into a garment, and of the village beauty who
wore it&mdash;until, faded and despised, it was cast amongst a heap of
old rags, and finally found its way to the tinder-box. Then the
Tinder might tell of its hopes; how, though now a blackened mass,
soiling everything that touched it, it would soon be wedded to
one of the great ministers of nature, and fly away on transparent
wings, until, resting upon some Alpine tree, it would make its
home among the green leaves, and for a while live in freshness
and beauty, looking down upon the peaceful vale. Then the Steel
might tell its story, how for centuries it lay in the deep caverns
of the earth, until man, with his unquiet spirit, dug down to
the dark depths and dragged it forth, saying, "No longer be at
peace." Then would come tales of the fiery furnace, what Fire had
done for Steel, and what Steel had done for Fire. And then the
Flint might tell of the time when the weather-bound mariners,
lighting their fires upon the Syrian shore, melted silicious
stones into gems of glass, and thus led the way to the discovery
of the transparent pane that gives a crystal inlet to the light
of our homes; of the mirror in whose face the lady contemplates
her charms; of the microscope and the telescope by which the
invisible are brought to sight, and the distant drawn near; of
the prism by which Newton analysed the rays of light; and of the
photographic camera in which the sun prints with his own rays the
pictures of his own adorning. And then both Flint and Steel might
relate their adventures in the battle-field, whither they had gone
together; and of fights they had seen in which man struck down his
fellow-man, and like a fiend had revelled in his brother's blood.
Thus, even from the cold hearts of flint and steel, man might
learn a lesson which should make him blush at the "glory of war;"
and the proud, who despise the teachings of small things, might
learn to appreciate the truths that are linked to the story of a
"tinder-box."</p>

<p><a id="question_342"></a>342. <i>Why does water never freeze to a great depth?</i></p>

<p>Because the covering of ice which is formed upon the surface of

<p><a id="question_343"></a>343. <i>Why has this exceptional law of the expansion of water, when

<p>Because, but for this, deep waters might be frozen through their
whole depth. This would destroy the myriads of fish and other
living things that inhabit the water. Parts of the earth, now clad
in verdure, would be lost in eternal winter; and even in the most
temperate zones it would take months to effect a thaw; and thawing
would be attended with such floods and subterranean commotion as are
terrible to contemplate.</p>

<p><a id="question_344"></a>344. <i>Why are bed-room windows sometimes covered with crystalline
forms on winter mornings?</i></p>

<p>Because the vapour of the breaths of the inmates has condensed upon
the window-panes, and formed water. The water has frozen with the
cold, and exhibits the beautiful crystalline forms into which its
particles are arranged.</p>

<p class="bq">Here we have another domestic illustration of the great laws of
nature. It is the same law which locks the arctic regions in ice
and decorates our window-panes. This beautiful phenomenon is
usually witnessed by us on frosty mornings when we rise from our
beds. It has a story which the observer of nature may read in its
sparkling eyes. It tells that, although without the air is biting
cold, God has wrapped a mantle around the face of nature to keep
it from injury; and that the earth and the waters, though looking
chilled and dead, have still the warmth of life preserved in their
bosoms.</p>

<p><a id="question_346"></a>346. <i>Why does the air become charged with watery vapour?</i></p>

<p>Because, during the day, under the influence of the sun's rays,
vapours are <i>exhaled</i> from all the moist and watery surfaces of the
earth. These vapours are <i>held in suspension</i> in the atmosphere
until, by a change in the temperature of the earth, and of bodies

<p>The earth, which during the day <i>received heat</i> from the solar rays,
<i>radiates the heat</i> back into the air, and therefore becomes itself
colder. All the various objects upon the face of the earth also
<i>radiate heat</i> in a greater or lesser degree. And dew will be found

back to the earth</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">If plates of glass be laid over grass-beds, as in the engraving
<a href="#i-087.jpg">Fig. 3</a>, no dew will be deposited on the grass underneath the glass
plates, although all around the grass will be completely wetted.
The explanation is that the glasses, being radiators of heat, act
in the same manner as the clouds, returning the heat to the bodies
underneath them, and preventing the formation of dew thereon.</p>

<p><a id="question_349"></a>349. <i>Why does dew form most abundantly on cloudless nights?</i></p>

<p>Because the heat which is radiated by the earth does not return to
it. The temperature of the earth, and the air immediately upon its
surface, is therefore lowered, and dew is formed.</p>

<p class="bq">It has been observed that sheep that have lain on the grass during
the formation of dew have their backs completely saturated with
it, but that underneath the line where their bodies turn to the
earth, their coats will be dry. In the same manner glass globes
suspended in the air, on dew forming nights, will be found loaded
with globules of dew upon the top, but there will be no appearance
of moisture underneath.</p>

<p><a id="question_350"></a>350. <i>Why are star-lit nights usually colder than cloudy nights?</i></p>

<p>Because heat is <i>radiated</i> from the earth, and passes away into the
utmost regions of the atmosphere.</p>

<p><a id="question_351"></a>351. <i>Why is there little dew under branches of thick foliage?</i></p>

<p>Because the foliage <i>acts as a screen</i>, which prevents the radiated
heat of the earth from passing away.</p>

<p><a id="question_352"></a>352. <i>Why is there no dew formed on windy nights?</i></p>

<p>Because, as winds generally consist of dry air, they <i>absorb and bear
away</i> the atmospheric moisture.</p>

<p><a id="question_353"></a>353. <i>Why are valleys and low places chiefly subject to dew?</i></p>

<p>Because the elevated lands around them <i>prevent the disturbance of
the air</i> in which the moisture is held.</p>

<p><a id="question_354"></a>354. <i>What bodies are most likely to be covered with dew?</i></p>

<p>All bodies that are <i>good radiators of heat</i>, such as wool,
swansdown, grass, leaves of plants, wood, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="question_355"></a>355. <i>What bodies are likely to receive little dew?</i></p>

<p>All <i>bad radiators of heat</i>, such as polished metal surfaces, smooth
stones, and polished surfaces generally. Dew will be found to lie
more abundantly upon rough and woolly leaves than upon smooth ones.</p>

<p><a id="question_356"></a>356. <i>At what period of the night is the largest amount of dew
usually formed?</i></p>

<p>It is generally supposed that dew is formed <i>most copiously</i> in
the <i>mornings</i> and <i>evenings</i>. But <i>such is not the case</i>. It is
deposited at all hours of the night, but <i>most plentifully after
midnight</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_357"></a>357. <i>Why is dew formed most plentifully after midnight?</i></p>

<p>Because, as <i>radiation</i> has been going on for some time, the
temperature of the earth, and of various bodies upon it, has been
<i>considerably reduced</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_359"></a>359. <i>In what parts of the world is the minimum of dew formed?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_360"></a>360. <i>Why is dew seldom formed at sea?</i></p>

<p>Hoar-frost is frozen dew.</p>

<p><a id="question_363"></a>363. <i>Why is hoar-frost said to foretell rain?</i></p>

<p>Because it shows that the air is saturated with moisture, and

vaporous folds the <i>smoke</i> and <i>volatile matters</i> imparted to the air
by the operations of man. This is also the case with fogs generally
that arise near large towns.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_366"></a>366. <i>Why are certain coasts liable to almost perpetual fogs?</i></p>

<p>Because of local or geographical agencies which contribute to their
production. The coasts of California are almost constantly wrapped
in fog; and, almost as constantly, the western coast of the American
continent, as far south as Peru. Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and
Hudson's Bay, are all subject to dense and frequent fogs arising
from the condensation of vapour from the water flowing from the hot
Gulf-stream, coming in contact with the colder air.</p>

<p><a id="question_367"></a>367. <i>What are dry fogs?</i></p>

<p>Dry fogs are characterised by a dull opaque appearance of the
atmosphere. They are most common in certain parts of North America,
though they sometimes occur in Germany and in England. They are
generally referred to the <i>electrical state of the atmosphere</i>, but
the theory of them is still a matter of doubt.</p>

<p><a id="question_368"></a>368. <i>What is a mist?</i></p>

<p>The term <i>mist</i> is generally applied to vapours that rise over
<i>marshy places</i>, or the surfaces of <i>water</i>, and roll or move over
the land.</p>

<p><a id="question_369"></a>369. <i>What is the difference between a mist and a fog?</i></p>

<p>Fogs, as they are known to us, generally arise over the <i>land</i>, and
are usually mingled with the smoke of large towns. Mists generally
arise over water, or wet surfaces.</p>

<p><a id="question_370"></a>370. <i>Why do mists and fogs disappear at sunrise?</i></p>

<p>Because the condensed vapours are again <i>expanded</i> and <i>dispersed</i> by
the heat of the sun's rays.</p>

<p><a id="question_371"></a>371. <i>Why do fogs frequently rise in the morning and fall again in
the evening?</i></p>

<p>Because, warmed by the sun's rays, they become more rarefied, and fly
away at an altitude where they <i>appear</i> to be altogether dispelled;
but at night, when the earth <i>cools by radiation</i>, the vapours near
the earth <i>again condense</i>, and settle in the <i>form of fog</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_372"></a>372. <i>Why do fogs sometimes rest upon a given locality for several
days together, and then disappear?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>They are probably kept near to the surface of the earth by a
superstratum of cold air. A cold air lying <i>above</i>, or a cold air
lying <i>below</i>, might equally contribute to keep a fog near the
surface of a particular part of the earth, until a <i>flow of wind</i>, or
a <i>fall of rain</i>, altered the atmospheric condition.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">There are many interesting facts connected with the history of
dew. It has attracted the attention of natural philosophers in all
ages. But its true theory was never understood until recently.
The ancients imagined that dews were shed from the stars; and the
alchemists and physicians of the middle ages believed that the
dew distilled by night possessed penetrating and wonder-working
powers. The ladies of those times sought to preserve their beauty
by washing in dew, which they regarded as a "celestial wash." They
collected it by placing upon the grass heaps of wool, upon the
threads of which the magic drops clustered.</p>

<p>From the <i>evaporation of water</i> at the earth's surface.</p>

<p><a id="question_375"></a>375. <i>Why do we not see them ascend?</i></p>

<p>We do, sometimes, in the form of what we call <i>mists</i>, but generally
the vapours that rise and contribute to the formation of clouds are
so thin that they are <i>invisible</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_376"></a>376. <i>Why, if they are invisible when they rise, do they became
visible when they have ascended?</i></p>

<p>Because the vapours become <i>cooled</i> in passing through the air, and
form a denser body.</p>

<p><a id="question_377"></a>377. <i>Why, when they are condensed, do they not follow the course of
gravitation, and descend?</i></p>

<p>Because the vapours form into <i>minute vesicles</i>, which we may
call <i>vapour bubbles</i>, and these, being warmed by the sun, are
specifically <i>lighter than the air</i>.</p>

<p>Because, also, the lower parts of clouds <i>do partially</i> descend, but
again becoming more <i>rarefied</i> by meeting with a <i>warmer atmosphere</i>,
they again ascend, and are thus <i>poised</i> upon the air.</p>

<p>Because, also, there is always a degree of atmospheric motion
<i>upward</i>, caused by the <i>convection of heat</i> from the earth's
surface. And, although there must also be downward movements of the
air to supply the place of that which has ascended, still <i>the heat</i>
of the ascending air, <i>combined with its upward movement</i>, expands
and floats the vapour of the clouds.</p>

<p><a id="question_378"></a>378. <i>At what height do clouds usually fly?</i></p>

<p>They fly at every degree of altitude; but clouds of <i>specific

<p class="bq">The estimated heights given must be looked upon as very
conjectural, although they have been derived from the best
existing authorities. It is sufficient to know that the range of
the altitude of the various clouds is from that of the <i>Nimbus</i>,
or <i>thunder cloud</i>, 1,500 feet, to that of the <i>Cirrus</i>, 24,000
feet, the others being intermediate. The first three of the clouds
above enumerated constitute what are called the <i>primary forms</i>.
The remaining four are called <i>secondary forms</i>, because they
arise, as their names generally indicate, out of combinations
of the <i>primary forms</i>. Although, from the frequent mingling of
clouds, it is not always practicable to identify them by the
adopted classification, still, as there is generally a prevalence
of one type of cloud over another, the observer would be able
to distinguish a <i>"Cirrus sky,"</i> or <i>"Cirro-cumulus sky,"</i>&amp;c.
Upon some occasions the typical characters of the clouds are
beautifully defined; and the contemplation of their forms, and
the laws of their formation, affords infinite pleasure to the
observer. The advantages of scientific knowledge are such, that
whether you look downwards, to the earth, or upwards to the sky,
you have still the writing of God to read.</p>

<p><a id="question_382"></a>382. <i>How are clouds affected by winds?</i></p>

<p>If <i>cold winds</i> blow upon the clouds, the cold condenses the vapour,

masses</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_384"></a>384. <i>Why are east winds usually dry?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_399"></a>399. <i>Why does the earth become colder than the air after sunset?</i></p>

<p>Because the earth <i>parts with its heat freely by radiation</i>;
 but the
air does not.</p>

<p><a id="question_400"></a>400. <i>Why do glasses, mats, or screens, prevent the frost from
hitting plants?</i></p>

<p>Because they prevent the <i>radiation of heat from the plants</i>, and
also from the earth beneath them.</p>

<p><a id="question_401"></a>401. <i>Why are the screens frequently covered with dew on their
exposed sides?</i></p>

<p>Because they radiate heat from <i>both their surfaces</i>. A piece
of glass, laid horizontally over the earth, would radiate heat
both <i>upwards</i> and <i>downwards</i>. But on its lower surface it would
<i>receive</i> the radiated heat of the earth, while from its upper
surface it would <i>throw off its own heat</i> and become cool. Therefore
dew would be deposited upon the <i>upper</i>, but not on the <i>under</i>
surface.</p>

<p><a id="question_402"></a>402. <i>Why does dew rest upon the upper surfaces of leaves?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="question_403"></a>403. <i>Why are cultivated lands subject to heavier dews than those
that are uncultivated?</i></p>

<p>Because cultivation breaks up the hard surface of the earth, and thus
<i>its radiating power is increased</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_404"></a>404. <i>Why is the gravel walk through a lawn comparatively dry while
the grass of the lawn is wet with dew?</i></p>

<p>Because gravel is a <i>bad radiator</i>, but grass is a <i>good radiator</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_405"></a>405. <i>What benefit results from this arrangement?</i></p>

<p>In cultivated lands, where moisture is required, it is <i>induced</i>
by the very necessity which demands it; while in rocky and barren
places, where it would be of no good, dew <i>does not form</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_406"></a>406. <i>Why does little dew form at the base of hedges and walls, and
around the trunks of trees?</i></p>

<p>Because those bodies in some degree <i>counteract the radiation</i> of
heat from the earth; and they also <i>radiate heat</i> from their own
substances.</p>

<p><a id="question_407"></a>407. <i>Why do heavy morning dews and mists usually come together?</i></p>

<p>Because they both have their origin in the <i>humidity of the
atmosphere</i>. The temperature of the earth having fallen, dew has been
deposited; but, at the same time, the condensation of the vapour in
the air <i>has formed a screen over the surface of the earth</i>, which
has checked <i>the further radiation of heat</i>, and, consequently,
<i>the further formation of dew</i>. The sun rises, therefore, upon an
atmosphere charged with visible vapour at the earth's surface, and
his first sloping rays, <i>having little power to warm the atmosphere</i>,
the mist <i>continues visible for some time</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_408"></a>408. <i>What effect have winds upon the formation of dew?</i></p>

<p>Winds, generally, and especially when rapid, prevent the formation
of dew. But those winds that are moist, and <i>contribute to the
formation of clouds</i>, indirectly aid the formation of dew <i>through
the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> formation of clouds</i>, and also by the <i>moisture they impart to
the air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_409"></a>409. <i>Why does the humidity of the atmosphere sometimes form clouds,
and at others form fogs, mists, dews, &amp;c.?</i></p>

<p>The result depends upon the varying <i>temperature</i>, <i>motion</i>, and
<i>direction</i> of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>A <i>warm light atmosphere</i>, of a few day's duration, will elevate the
vapours to the region where they are formed into <i>clouds</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>chill air</i>, lying upon the surface of the warmer earth, will
occasion <i>mists</i> or <i>fogs</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>cold earth</i>, acting upon the vapours contained in a <i>warmer
atmosphere</i>, will condense them and occasion <i>dews</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_410"></a>410. <i>Why are frosty mornings usually clear?</i></p>

<p>Because, in the cold atmosphere which preceded the frost, <i>there
was but little evaporation</i>;
 and now that the frost has set in, the
vapours that existed have become <i>frozen</i> in the form of <i>hoar-frost</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_411"></a>411. <i>Why are clear nights usually cold?</i></p>

<p>Because the "screen" afforded by the clouds does not exist; therefore
the heat of the earth escapes, while the vapours of the air are
abstracted from it by condensation into dew, thereby imparting great
<i>clearness to the nights</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_412"></a>412. <i>Why are hoar-frosts, or, as they are termed, "white frosts," so
frequent, and "black frosts" so unusual?</i></p>

<p>Because white, or <i>hoar frosts</i>, result from the <i>coldness of the
earth</i>, which, from its great radiating power, is always varying. But
<i>black-frosts</i> result from the <i>coldness of the air</i>, which is liable
to less variation of temperature than the earth.</p>

<p><a id="question_413"></a>413. <i>What is a black-frost?</i></p>

<p>A <i>black-frost</i> results from the <i>coldness of the atmosphere</i>, which
is at the time overshadowed by a dull cloud, giving a darkness to
everything, and a leaden appearance to the <i>frozen surface of water</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_414"></a>414. <i>Why are black-frosts said to last?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Because as they result from the temperature of the air, which is less
likely to vary than that of the earth, there is a probability that
the coldness thereof <i>will last for some time</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And God did so that night: for it was dry upon

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_415"></a>415. <i>What benefits result from the radiation of heat, &amp;c.?</i></p>

<p>But for the <i>radiation of heat</i>, we should be subjected to the most
unequal temperatures. The setting of the sun would be like <i>the going
out of a mighty fire</i>. The earth would become <i>suddenly cold</i>, and
its inhabitants would have to bury themselves in warm covering, to
wait the return of day. By the <i>radiation</i> of heat, an <i>equilibrium
of temperature</i> is provided for, without which we should require a
new order of existence.</p>

<p class="bq">The amount of heat which our earth <i>receives from the sun</i>, and
the economy of that heat by the laws of <i>radiation</i>, <i>reflection</i>,
<i>absorption</i>, and <i>convection</i>, are exactly proportionate to the
necessities of our planet, and the living things that inhabit
it. It is held by philosophers that any change in the orbit of
our earth, which would either increase or decrease the amount of
heat falling upon it, would, of necessity, be followed by the
<i>annihilation of all the existing races</i>. The planets Mercury and
Venus, which are distant respectively 37 millions of miles, and 63
millions of miles, from the great source of solar heat, possess
a temperature which would <i>melt our solid rocks</i>;
 while Uranus
(1,800 millions of miles), and Neptune (whose distance from the
sun has not been determined), must receive so small an amount
of heat, that water, such as ours, would become as solid as the
hardest rock, and our atmosphere would be resolved into a liquid!
Yet, poised in the mysterious balance of opposing forces, our orb
flies unerringly on its course, at the rate of 63,000 miles an
hour; preserving, in its wonderful flight, that precise relation
to the sun, which takes from his life-inspiring rays the exact
degree of heat, which, being shared by every atom of matter, and
every form of organic existence, <i>is just the amount needed to
constitute the heat-life of the world</i>!</p>

<p><a id="question_416"></a>416. <i>What is rain?</i></p>

<p>Rain is the <i>vapour of the clouds</i> which, being condensed by a fall
of temperature, forms drops of water that descend to the earth.</p>

<p>It is the <i>return to the earth</i> in the form of <i>water</i>, of the
moisture <i>absorbed by the air</i> in the form of <i>vapour</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_417"></a>417. <i>Does rain ever occur without clouds?</i></p>

<p>It sometimes, but rarely happens, that a sudden transition from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
warmth to cold will <i>precipitate the moisture of the air</i>, without
the formation of <i>visible clouds</i>.</p>

<p class="center bq">"Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_418"></a>418. <i>Why are drops of rain sometimes large and at other times small?</i></p>

<p>Because the drops, in falling, <i>meet and unite</i>, and also gather
<i>moisture</i> in their descent. The greater the height from which a
rain drop has descended, <i>the larger it is</i>, provided that its whole
course lay through a <i>rainy atmosphere</i>.</p>

<p>The size of the drops is also influenced by the <i>amount of moisture
in the atmosphere</i>, the <i>degree of cold</i>, and the <i>rapidity</i> of the
<i>change of temperature</i>, by which the drops are produced.</p>

<p><a id="question_419"></a>419. <i>In what seasons of the year are rains most prevalent?</i></p>

<p>Throughout <i>Central Europe</i> rains are most prevalent in <i>summer</i>,
but in <i>Southern Europe</i> the preponderance is on the side of <i>winter
rains</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_420"></a>420. <i>In what months of the year does it rain most frequently in this

<p>It rains more frequently <i>from September to March</i>, than from
<i>March to September</i>;
 but the <i>heaviest rains</i> occur from <i>March to
September</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_421"></a>421. <i>Why are there more rainy days from September to March?</i></p>

<p>Because the temperature of the air is more frequently lowered to that
degree which <i>precipitates its vapours</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_423"></a>423. <i>In what part of the world do the heaviest rains occur?</i></p>

<p>The <i>heaviest</i> rains occur in the <i>tropics</i>, during the hot season.
The drops of rain in the tropical regions are so large, and the force
with which they descend so great, that their splash upon the skin
causes a <i>smarting sensation.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_424"></a>424. <i>In what parts of the world do the least rains occur?</i></p>

<p>There are some parts of the earth which are <i>rainless</i>, such as
Egypt, the desert of Sahara, the table lands of Persia and Montgolia,
the rocky flat of Arabia Petræ, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="question_425"></a>425. <i>How many rainy days are there in a year?</i></p>

<p>The frequency of rainy days is greatest in countries near the sea,
and their number decreases the further we journey from the sea-border
towards the inland. In England it rains on an average 152 to 155 days
in the year.</p>

<p><a id="question_426"></a>426. <i>In what part of England does the greatest amount of rain fall?</i></p>

<p>In the town of <i>Keswick</i>, in Cumberland, where 63 inches of rain fall
in a year; Kendal, in Westmoreland, 58 inches; Liverpool, 34 inches;
Dublin, 25 inches; Lincoln, 24 inches; London, 21 inches.</p>

<p><a id="question_427"></a>427. <i>Why do the heaviest rains occur at the tropics?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>hot air</i> absorbs a large amount of vapour, and rises
into the higher regions of the atmosphere, where the vapours are
<i>suddenly condensed into heavy rains</i>, by cold currents from the
poles.</p>

<p><a id="question_428"></a>428. <i>Why does the greatest quantity of rain fall at the equator?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>hot air</i> absorbs a large amount of vapour, and as the
atmosphere is usually calm, there is an absence of currents, by which
the saturated air would be removed. In this, which is called "<i>the
Region of Calms</i>," rain falls almost daily.</p>

<p><a id="question_429"></a>429. <i>Why are some parts of the earth rainless?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Because, being situated in tropical or torrid latitudes, and at a

<p><a id="question_430"></a>430. <i>When is air said to be saturated with vapour?</i></p>

<p>When it cannot take up <i>a larger quantity</i> than that which it already
holds.</p>

<p class="bq">When common salt is dissolved in water, until the water can take
up no more, the water is then said to be <i>saturated with salt</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_431"></a>431. <i>What proportion of water is air capable of sustaining in the
form of vapour?</i></p>

<p>The amount of water held in suspension by the air averages the
following proportion: one thousand <i>cubic feet of air</i> contain as
much vapour as, were it condensed to water, would yield about <i>two
fifths of a pint</i>.</p>

<p>But <i>one thousand cubic feet of air</i> are capable of holding
<i>half-a-pint of water</i>;
 and this may be regarded as the <i>point of
saturation</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">Thus, in a room ten feet square and ten feet high, the air, <i>at
the point of saturation</i>, would hold in the form of vapour,
<i>half-a-pint of water</i>. It must not be forgotten, however, that
the point of saturation necessarily varies with the <i>temperature
of the air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_432"></a>432. <i>Why are cloudy days and nights not always wet?</i></p>

<p>Because the air has not reached the state of <i>saturation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_433"></a>433. <i>Why does rain purify the air?</i></p>

<p>Because it produces motion in the particles of the air, by which they
are <i>intermixed</i>. And it precipitates noxious <i>vapours</i>, and cleanses
the face of the earth from <i>unhealthy accumulations</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_434"></a>434. <i>Why are mountainous localities more rainy than flat ones?</i></p>

<p>Because the mountains <i>attract the clouds</i>;

directed upwards, where they meet with <i>cold currents of air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_435"></a>435. <i>Why does more rain fall by night than by day?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Because by night the temperature of the air, heated during the day,
falls to that degree which condenses <i>its vapours into rain</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_436"></a>436. <i>Why do bunches of dried sea-weed indicate the probability of

<p>Because they readily imbibe moisture, and when they become soft and
damp they show that the air is <i>approaching the point of saturation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_437"></a>437. <i>Why does the weather-toy, called the "weather-cock," foretell
the probability of rain?</i></p>

<p>Because it is made with a piece of cat-gut which swells with
moisture, and as it swells, <i>shrinks</i>. The cat-gut is so applied
that when it <i>shrinks</i>, it turns a rod which sends the <i>man</i> out of
the house, and when it <i>dries</i> it sends the <i>woman out</i>. Therefore,
when the <i>man</i> appears, it is a sign of <i>wet</i>, and when the <i>woman</i>
appears it is a sign of <i>dry weather</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">There is another toy, called the Capuchin, which is made upon the
same principle. The figure lifts a hood over its head when wet
is approaching, and takes it off when the weather is becoming
dry. In this case, a piece of cat-gut is also employed. Various
weather-toys may be made upon this principle&mdash;among others, a
little umbrella, which will open on the approach of wet, and close
on the return of fine weather.</p>

<p class="bq">A gentleman once made a wooden horse, which he declared should
of itself walk across a room, without machinery of any kind. The
assertion was discredited; but the horse was placed in a room
close to the wall on one side. The room was locked, and otherwise
fastened, so that no one could interfere with the experiment.
After a time the door was opened, and it was found that the horse
had actually crossed the floor, and stood on the opposite side.
The horse was made from wood of a peculiar kind, liable to great
expansion in wet weather, and cut in a manner to produce the
greatest elongation. The fore hoofs were so made that where they
were set they would remain, so that the contracting parts should
draw up from behind. It is easy to understand how, in this way,
the wooden horse crossed the apartment.</p>

<p><a id="question_440"></a>440. <i>What is snow?</i></p>

<p>Snow is <i>congealed vapour</i>, which would have formed <i>rain</i>;
 but,
through the coldness of the air, has been <i>frozen</i> in its descent
into <i>crystalline forms</i>. (<a href="#i-053.jpg">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="question_441"></a>441. <i>Why is snow white?</i></p>

<p>Because it reflects all the component rays of <i>light</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_442"></a>442. <i>Why is snow said to be warm, while white garments are worn for
coolness?</i></p>

<p>Snow is <i>warm</i> by virtue of its light and woolly texture. But it is
also warm on account of its <i>whiteness</i>;
 for, had it been <i>black</i>, it
would have <i>absorbed the heat of the sun</i>, which would have <i>thawed
the snow</i>. Instead of which, it <i>reflects heat</i>;
 and the reflected
heat <i>falls upon</i> bodies above the snow, while the <i>warmth of the
earth</i> is preserved <i>beneath it</i>. <i>White clothing is cool</i>, because
it reflects <i>from</i> the body of the wearer the heat of the sun. <i>White
snow</i> is <i>warm</i>, because it <i>reflects the sun's heat upon bodies</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">There are few persons but have felt the effect of the sun's rays
<i>reflected</i> by the white snow on a clear wintry day. And, as
regards the warmth of snow towards the earth, by preventing the
radiation of heat, it has been found that a thermometer buried
four inches deep in snow has shown a temperature of <i>nine degrees</i>
higher than at the surface.</p>

<p><a id="question_443"></a>443. <i>Why are lofty mountains always covered with snow?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>upper regions</i> of the atmosphere are <i>intensely cold</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_444"></a>444. <i>Why are the upper regions of the atmosphere intensely cold?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>atmosphere</i> retains but <i>little of the heat of the
sun's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> rays</i> as they pass to the earth. Because at high altitudes the
air is <i>greatly rarefied</i>. And because the <i>radiation of heat from
the earth</i> does not materially affect such <i>high regions</i>.</p>

<p class="center bq">"He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_445"></a>445. <i>What is meant by the snow line?</i></p>

<p>The <i>snow line</i> is the estimated altitude in <i>all countries</i> where
<i>snow would be formed</i>. Even at the equator, at an altitude of 15,000
to 16,000 feet from the level of the sea, snow is found upon the
mountain summits, where it perpetually lies. As we proceed north or
south from the equator the <i>snow line lessens in altitude</i>. Had we in
England a mountain 6,000 feet high, it would be perpetually <i>crowned
with snow</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_446"></a>446. <i>Why do we hear of red snow?</i></p>

<p>Red snow is the name given to the snow in the arctic regions upon
which a minute vegetable (probably the <i>Protoccus nivalis</i>) grows,
imparting to the snow a red colour. Recent microscopic investigations
have shown it to consist of a minute vegetable cell, which secretes a
red colouring matter.</p>

<p class="bq">Snow is found to be of greater importance to man than is generally
supposed. But, although in this country we are enabled to
recognise the hand of Providence in the gift, there are latitudes
wherein the blessing thus conferred is more deeply felt. In such
countries as Canada, Sweden, and Russia, the falling of snow
is looked for with glad anticipations, quite equalling those
which herald the "harvest-home" of England, or the "vintage" of
France. No sooner is the ground covered with snow, than cranky
old vehicles that had been jolting over rough roads, and sticking
fast in deep ruts of mud, are wheeled aside, and swift sledges
take their place. Towns distant from each other find an easy mode
of communication; the markets are enlivened, and trade thrives.
Snow supplies a kind of railroad, covering the entire face of the
country, and sledges glide over it, almost with the speed of the
locomotive.</p>

<p><a id="question_447"></a>447. <i>What is sleet?</i></p>

<p><i>Sleet</i> is snow which, in falling, has met with a <i>warmer current of
air</i> than that in which it congealed. It therefore partially melts
and forms a kind of <i>wet snow</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_448"></a>448. <i>What is hail?</i></p>

<p><i>Hail</i> is also the <i>frozen moisture of the clouds</i>. It is probably
formed by <i>rain drops</i> in their descent to the earth, meeting with
an <i>exceedingly cold current of air</i> by which they become <i>suddenly
frozen into hard masses</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It is also supposed that the <i>electrical</i> state of the air and of the
clouds influences the formation of <i>hail</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_449"></a>449. <i>Why is it supposed that the electrical state of the air and the
clouds affects the formation of hail?</i></p>

<p>Because hail is more common in the <i>summer</i> than at other seasons,
and is frequently attended by storms of <i>thunder and lightning</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_450"></a>450. <i>Why do hail-storms most frequently occur by day?</i></p>

<p>Because the clouds, being charged with vapour to saturation, favour
the formation of hail by <i>sudden</i> electrical or atmospheric changes.
In the gradual cooling of night, the clouds would expend themselves
in rain.</p>

<p class="bq">Astonishing facts respecting hail-storms are upon record. In 1719
there fell at Kremo, hailstones weighing six pounds. In 1828 there
was a fall of ice at Horsley, in Staffordshire, some of the pieces
of which were three inches long, by one inch broad; and other
solid pieces were about three inches in circumference. Hail storms
are most frequent in June and July, and least frequent in April
and October. Hail clouds float much lower in the sky than other
clouds; their edges are marked by frequent heavy folds; and their
lower edges are streaked with white, the other portions being
massive and black. (<a href="#i-098.jpg">Fig. 10</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="question_451"></a>451. <i>What is light?</i></p>

<p>Light, according to Newton, is the effect of luminous particles which
dart from the surfaces of bodies in all directions. According to this
theory, the solar light which we receive would <i>depart from the sun
and travel to the earth</i>.</p>

<p>According to Huyghens, light is caused by an <i>infinitely elastic
ether, diffused through all space</i>. This ether, existing everywhere,
is <i>excited into waves, or vibrations, by the luminous body</i>.</p>
<p class="bq">The theory of light is so undetermined that neither the views
of Newton, nor those of Huyghens, can be said to be exclusively
adopted. Writers upon natural philosophy seize hold of either or
both of those theories, as they present themselves more or less
favourably in the explanation of natural phenomena. In "<i>The
Reason Why,"</i> as we have to speak of the <i>effects</i> of light rather
than of its <i>cause</i>, we shall avoid, as far as possible, the
doubtful points. But let no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
one be discouraged by the fact that
the theory of light, as, indeed, of all the imponderable agents,
is imperfectly understood. Rather let us rejoice that there are
vast fields of discovery yet to be explored; and that light, the
most glorious and inspiring element in nature, invites us from the
sun, the moon, and the stars, and from the face of every green
leaf and variegated flower, to search out the wonders of its
nature, and further to exemplify the goodness and wisdom of God.</p>

<p><a id="question_464"></a>464. <i>What is the constitution of a ray of light?</i></p>

<p>A ray of <i>white light</i>, as we receive it from the sun, is composed of
<i>a number of elementary rays</i>, which, with the aid of a triangular
piece of glass, called a <i>prism</i>, may be separated, and will produce
under refraction the following colours:&mdash;</p>

<p> 1. An <i>extreme red</i> ray&mdash;a mixture of <i>red</i> and <i>blue</i>, the red
<i>predominating</i>.</p>

<p> 2. <i>Red.</i></p>

<p> 3. <i>Orange</i>&mdash;red passing into and combining with yellow.</p>

<p> 4. <i>Yellow</i>&mdash;the most luminous of all the rays.</p>

<p> 5. <i>Green</i>&mdash;yellow passing into and combining with the blue.</p>

<p> 6. <i>Blue.</i></p>

<p> 7. <i>Indigo</i>&mdash;a dark and intense blue.</p>

<p> 8. <i>Violet</i>&mdash;blue mingled with red.</p>

<p> 9. <i>Lavender grey</i>&mdash;a neutral tint.</p>

<p>10. Rays called <i>fluorescent</i>, which are either of a <i>pure silvery
blue</i>, or a <i>delicate green</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_465"></a>465. <i>Why is a ray of light, which contains these elementary rays,
white?</i></p>

<p>Because the colour of light is governed by the <i>rapidity of the
vibrations of the ether-waves</i>. When a ray of light is refracted
by, or transmitted through a body, its <i>vibrations are frequently
disturbed and altered</i>, and thus a <i>different impression</i> is made
upon the <i>eye</i>.</p>

<p>Light which gives 37,640 vibrations in <i>an inch</i>, or
458,000,000,000,000 in a <i>second of time</i>, produces that sensation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
upon the eye which makes the object that directs the vibrations
appear <i>red</i>. <i>Yellow</i> light requires 44,000 vibrations <i>in an
inch</i>, and 535,000,000,000,000 in a <i>second of time</i>. And the other
colours enumerated (<i>see</i> <a href="#question_464">464</a>) all require different <i>velocities of
vibration</i> to produce the colours by which they are distinguished.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore
thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matt.
v.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Accepting the theory of vibrations, and applying it to the
elucidation of the phenomena of light&mdash;it is unnecessary, we
think, to believe that a ray of <i>white</i> light <i>contains</i> rays
in <i>a state of colour</i>. It is said that if we divide a circular
surface into parts, and paint the various colours in the order
and proportions in which they occur in the refracted ray, and
then spin the circle with great velocity, the colours will blend
and appear <i>white</i>. But such is not the case; the result is in
some degree an illusion, arising out of the sudden removal of the
impression made upon the eye by the colours; and if a piece of
white paper be held by the side of the coloured circle in motion,
the latter will be found to be <i>grey</i>. When it is remembered
that in colouring a white surface with thin colours, the white
materially qualifies the colours, it must be admitted that the
experiment fails to support the assertion that the colours of
the spectrum produce white. But there can be no difficulty in
understanding that a ray of light undergoing <i>refraction</i>, becomes
divided into minor rays, which <i>differing in their degrees of
refrangibility</i>, vary also in the <i>velocity of their vibrations</i>,
and produce the several sensations of colour.</p>

<p><a id="question_466"></a>466. <i>Why is a substance white?</i></p>

<p>Because it reflects the light that falls upon it <i>without altering
its vibrations.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_467"></a>467. <i>Why is a substance black?</i></p>

<p>Because it <i>absorbs the light</i> and <i>puts an end to the vibrations</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_468"></a>468. <i>Why is the rose red?</i></p>

<p>Because it imparts to the light that falls upon it that <i>change in
its vibratory condition</i>, which produces on our eyes the <i>sensation
of redness</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_469"></a>469. <i>Why is the lily white?</i></p>

<p>Because it reflects the light without altering its vibrations.</p>

<p><a id="question_470"></a>470. <i>Why is the primrose yellow?</i></p>

<p>Because, though it receives white light, it alters its vibrations to
44,000 in an inch, and 535,000,000,000,000 in a second, and this is
the velocity of vibration which produces upon the eye a <i>sensation</i>
of <i>yellow</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_471"></a>471. <i>Why are there so many varieties of colour and tint in the
various objects in nature?</i></p>

<p>Because every surface has a peculiar constitution, or atomic
condition, <i>by which the light falling upon it is influenced</i>. In
tropical climates, where the brightness of the sun is the most
intense, there the colours of natural objects are the richest; the
foliage is of the darkest green; the flowers and fruits present the
brightest hues; and the plumage of the birds is of the most gaudy
description. In the temperate climates these features are more
subdued, still bearing relation to the degree of light. And at a
certain depth of the ocean, where light penetrates only in a slight
degree, the objects that abound are nearly colourless.</p>

<p class="bq">It has been held by many philosophers (and the theory is so far
conclusive that it cannot be dispensed with) that there is an
analogy between the vibratory causes of <i>sound</i>, and the vibratory
causes of <i>colour</i>. Any one who has seen an Æolian harp, and
listened to the wild notes of its music, will be aware that the
wires of the harp are swept by accidental currents of air; that
when those currents have been strong, the notes of the harp
have been raised to the highest pitch, and as the intensity of
the currents has fallen, the musical sounds have deepened and
softened, until, with melodious sighing, they have died away. No
finger has touched the strings; no musical genius has presided
at the harp to wake its inspiring sounds; but the vibration
imparted to the air, as it swept the wires, has alone produced the
chromatic sounds that have charmed the listener. If, then, the
varied vibrations of the <i>air</i> are capable of imparting dissimilar
sensations of <i>sounds</i> to the <i>ear</i>, is it not only possible, but
probable, that the different vibrations of <i>light</i> may impart the
various sensations of <i>colours</i> to the <i>eye</i>?</p>

<p><a id="question_472"></a>472. <i>What is the refraction of light?</i></p>

<p>When rays of light fall <i>obliquely</i> upon the surface of any
<i>transparent medium</i>, they are slightly diverted from their course.
This alteration of the course of the rays is called <i>refraction</i>, and
the degree of refraction is influenced by the difference between the
<i>densities</i> of the mediums <i>through which light is transmitted</i>.</p>

<p>A ray of light falling slantingly upon a <i>window</i>, in passing through

 and if it then falls
upon the surface of water, it is still further brought to the
perpendicular in <i>passing through the water</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_475"></a>475. <i>Is light refracted in passing from a dense medium to a thinner

<p>It is; but the <i>direction of the refraction</i> is just the opposite to
the instance just given; a ray of light passing through <i>water</i> into
<i>air</i>, does not take a more <i>perpendicular course</i>, but becomes more
<i>oblique</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>refraction</i> of the sun's rays by the <i>falling rain</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_487"></a>487. <i>Why does the rainbow exhibit various colours?</i></p>

<p>The colours belong to the <i>elementary rays of light</i>;

having <i>different degrees of refrangibility</i>, some of them are bent
more than others; they are therefore separated into <i>distinct rays of
different colours</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_488"></a>488. <i>Why are there sometimes two rainbows?</i></p>

secondary bow.</p>

<p><a id="question_489"></a>489. <i>Why are the colours of the secondary bow arrayed in the reverse
order of the primary bow?</i></p>

<p>Because the secondary bow is <i>a reflection</i> of the primary bow, and,
like all reflections, is reversed.</p>

<p><a id="question_490"></a>490. <i>Why are reflections reversed?</i></p>

<p>Because those rays which <i>first reach</i> the reflecting surface
are the <i>first returned</i>. If you hold your open hand towards the
looking-glass, the light passing from the point of your finger will
reach the reflector and be returned before the rays that pass from
the back parts of the hand. Hence the image of the hand will present
the reflection of the finger point towards the point of the finger.</p>

<p><a id="question_491"></a>491. <i>Why are the colours of the secondary rainbow fainter than those

<p>The <i>refraction</i> of the rays of light by the various <i>facets</i> of the
diamond.</p>

<p class="bq">The refraction of light, and the production of prismatic colours,
surrounds us with most interesting phenomena. The laundress,
whose active labours raise over the wash-tub a soapy froth,
performs inadvertently one of the most delicate operations of
chemistry&mdash;the chemistry of the imponderable agents&mdash;and the
result of her manipulations manifests itself in the delicate
colours that dance like a fairy light over the glassy films that
follow the motion of her arms. The laughing child, throwing a
bubble from the bowl of a tobacco pipe into the air, performs
the same experiment, and produces a result such as that which
filled the philosophic Newton with unbounded joy. The foam of the
seashore, the plumage of birds, the various films that float upon
the surface of waters, the delicate tints of flowers, and the rich
hues of luscious fruits, all combine to remind us, that every ray
of light comes like an angelic artist sent from heaven, bearing
upon his palette the most celestial tints, with which to beautify
the earth, and show the illimitable glory of God.</p>

<p><a id="question_502"></a>502. <i>What is the difference between the refraction and the
reflection of light?</i></p>

<p><i>Refraction</i> is the deviation of rays of light from their course
through the interference of a <i>different</i> medium; <i>reflection</i> is
the return of rays of light which, having fallen upon a surface, are
repelled by it.</p>

<p><a id="question_503"></a>503. <i>What is the radiation of light?</i></p>

<p>The <i>radiation</i> of light is its <i>emission in rays</i> from the surface
of a <i>luminous body</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_504"></a>504. <i>Do all bodies radiate light?</i></p>

<p>All bodies radiate light; but those that are not in themselves
primary sources of light, are said to <i>reflect it</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_505"></a>505. <i>Do black bodies reflect any light?</i></p>

<p>Black bodies <i>absorb</i> the light that falls upon them. But they
reflect a <i>very small</i> degree of light.</p>

light to continue through their substance.</p>

<p><a id="question_507"></a>507. <i>Does glass obstruct the passage of any portion of light?</i></p>

<p>Glass <i>reflects</i> (sends back) a very small portion of light. This may
be observed by holding a piece of paper, or a hand, a few inches from
a window, when a faint reflection of it will be visible. Probably the
small amount of light <i>reflected by transparent glass, which gives a
passage to the greater part of the rays</i>, may serve to illustrate the
small amount of light reflected from <i>black surfaces</i>, which <i>absorbs
the greater portion of light</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">Instead of a piece of white paper, hold a piece of <i>black cloth</i>
two or three inches from the window-pane, and you will have two
reflections so weak that the image of the cloth will be almost
lost. The first reflection is that of the very small amount of
light from the black surface on to the glass, and the second
reflection is that of the inconceivably small amount returned by
the glass, and by which the faint image of the black cloth is
produced. But put the black cloth outside of the window-pane, and
then hold an object before them, and you will find that the <i>two
weak reflectors, acting together</i>, produce an improved image, or
reflection.</p>

<p><a id="question_508"></a>508. <i>Why, if a book is held between a candle-light and the wall,
does a shadow fall upon the wall?</i></p>

<p>Because the rays of light are <i>intercepted</i> by the book.</p>

<p><a id="question_509"></a>509. <i>Why do the rays pass over the edges of the book in a direct
line with the flame of the candle?</i></p>

<p>Because light always travels in <i>straight lines</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_510"></a>510. <i>Why is there some amount of light even where shadows fall?</i></p>

<p>Because, <i>as all objects reflect light</i>, some of them throw their
light into the field of the shadow.</p>

<p><a id="question_511"></a>511. <i>Why are some substances opaque to light?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_512"></a>512. <i>Why do we see our faces reflected in mirrors?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the rays of light from our faces are <i>reflected</i> by the
surface of the <i>quicksilver</i> at the back of the glass.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou
hast prepared the light and the sun."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm lxxiv.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_513"></a>513. <i>Why does the quicksilver reflect the rays of light?</i></p>

<p>Because, being <i>densely opaque to light</i>, and presenting also a
bright surface, it is a good reflector, and it <i>throws back the whole
of the rays</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_514"></a>514. <i>What has the glass to do with the reflection?</i></p>

<p>The glass has <i>nothing to do with the reflection</i>, except that it
affords a field upon which the reflecting surface of the quicksilver
is spread; and it keeps the air and dirt from <i>dulling the
quicksilver</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">The parts of a mirror from which the quicksilver is rubbed away
give no reflection that could assist the reflecting power of the
quicksilver. That the surface of the glass does not reflect the
image, is shown by the fact, that if you put the point of any
object against the glass, the thickness between the point and the
place where the reflection of it begins, will <i>show the exact
thickness of the glass</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_515"></a>515. <i>Why does a compound mirror (a multiplying mirror) exhibit a
large number of images of one object.</i></p>

<p>Because all objects reflect rays of light in <i>every direction</i>, and
therefore the different mirrors, being at <i>various angles</i>, receive
<i>each a reflection</i> of the same object.</p>

<p><a id="question_516"></a>516. <i>Why does a window-pane appear to be a better reflector by
candle-light than by day-light?</i></p>

<p>The reflecting power of glass is precisely the same by night as by
day, and is always very feeble. But it appears to be greater by
night, <i>because the surrounding darkness increases the apparent
strength of the reflection</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_517"></a>517. <i>How do we know that objects reflect light in every direction?</i></p>

<p>Because if we <i>prick a hole in a card with a pin</i>, and then look
through that small hole upon a <i>landscape</i>, we can see some miles of
country, and some thousands of objects; every part of every object
throughout the whole scene, must have sent rays of light the small
hole pricked in the card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p class="center bq">"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is
high, I cannot attain unto it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm cxxxix.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">At one extremity of the landscape, viewed through the hole in the
card, there may be a forest of trees; in the distance there may be
hills bathed in golden light, and overhung with glittering clouds;
in the mid-distance there may be a river winding its course along,
as though it loved the earth through which it ran, and wished,
by wandering to and fro, to refresh the thirsty soil; in the
foreground may be a church, covered by a million ivy leaves; and
grouping towards the sacred edifice may be hundreds of intending
worshippers, old and young, rich and poor; flowers may adorn the
path-ways, and butterflies spangle the air with their beauties;
yet every one of those objects&mdash;the forest, the hills, the clouds,
the river, the church, the ivy, the people, the flowers, the
butterflies&mdash;must have sent rays of light, which found their way
through the little hole in the card, and entered to paint the
picture upon the curtain of the eye.</p>

<p class="bq">This is one of the most striking instances that can be afforded
of the wonderful properties of light, and of the infinitude of
those luminous rays that attend the majestic rising of the sun.
Not only does light fly from the grand "ruler of the day" with
a velocity which is a million and a half times greater than
the speed of a cannon-ball, but it darts from every reflecting
surface with a like velocity, and reaches the tender structure of
the eye so gently that, as it falls upon the little curtain of
nerves which is there spread to receive it, it imparts the most
pleasing sensations, and tells its story of the outer world with a
minuteness of detail, and a holiness of truth. Philosophers once
sought to <i>weigh</i> the <i>sunbeam</i>;
 they constructed a most delicate
balance, and suddenly let in upon it a beam of light; the lever
of the balance was so delicately hung that the fluttering of a
fly would have disturbed it. Everything prepared, the grave men
took their places, and with keen eyes watched the result. The
sunbeam that was to decide the experiment had left the sun eight
minutes prior to pass the ordeal. It had flown through ninety-five
millions of miles of space in that short measure of time, and it
shot upon the balance with unabated velocity: but the lever moved
not, and the philosophers were mute.</p>

<p><a id="question_522"></a>522. <i>What is the angle of reflection?</i></p>

<p>The <i>angle</i> of reflection is the angle which is formed by the
returning rays of light, and a line perpendicular to the reflecting
surface. It is always <i>equivalent</i> to the angle of incidence.</p>

<p class="bq">Take a marble and roll it across the floor, so that it shall
strike the wainscot obliquely. Let A in the diagram represent the
point from which the marble is sent. The marble will not return to
the hand, nor will it travel to the line B, but will bound off, or
be <i>reflected</i>, to C. Now B is an imaginary line, <i>perpendicular
to the reflecting surface</i>;
 and it will be found that the path
described by the marble in <i>rolling to the surface and rebounding
from it</i>, form, with the line B, two angles that are <i>equal</i>.
These represent the angles of <i>incidence</i> and of <i>reflection</i>,
and explain why the reflection of a person standing at A before a
mirror, would be seen by another person standing at C. This simple
law in optics explains a great many interesting phenomena, and
therefore it should be clearly impressed upon the memory.</p>

<p><a id="question_525"></a>525. <i>Why do the sun and moon appear smaller when near the meridian,
than when near the horizon?</i></p>

<p>Because, when near the horizon, they are brought into <i>comparison
with the sizes of terrestrial objects</i>;
 but when near the meridian
they occupy the centre of a vast field of sky, and as there are no
objects of comparison surrounding them, they <i>appear smaller</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">This is one "Reason Why," assigned by some observers. But there is
also another reason to be found in the fact that, when the sun or
moon is near the horizon, we view it through a <i>greater depth of
atmosphere</i> than we do when at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the meridian. (<i>See</i> <a href="#i-114.jpg">Fig. 13</a>.) A
straight line passed upward through the air, would not be so long
as that which passes to S. Consequently, as the air is generally
impregnated with moisture, at the time when these effects are
observed, the rays of light are caused to diverge more, and the
disc of the sun or moon <i>appears magnified</i>. Probably both of
these reasons contribute to the effect. This latter reason also
explains why the disc of the sun or moon may sometimes appear
<i>oval</i> in shape, the lower stratum of air being more loaded with
moisture than that through which we view the upper part of the
disc.</p>

<p><a id="question_528"></a>528. <i>Why do we have twilight mornings and evenings?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_529"></a>529. <i>How long before the sun appears above the horizon does the
reflection of his light reach us?</i></p>

<p>The time <i>varies</i> with the refracting and reflecting power of the

position is usually <i>eighteen degrees</i> below the horizon when
twilight begins or ends.</p>

<p><a id="question_530"></a>530. <i>Why is the sky blue?</i></p>

<p>The white light of the sun falls upon the earth without change; it
is then reflected back by the earth, and as it passes through the
atmosphere portions of it are again returned to us, and this double
reflection produces a <i>polarised</i> condition of light which imparts to
vision the sensation of a <i>delicate blue</i>. (<i>See</i>
<a href="#question_549">549</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="question_531"></a>531. <i>Why do the clouds appear white?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_532"></a>532. <i>Why does the sky appear red at sunset?</i></p>

<p>Because the light vapours of the air, which are condensed as the sun

which produces <i>red</i> requires only a <i>moderate degree of density</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_533"></a>533. <i>Why do the clouds sometimes appear yellow?</i></p>

<p>Because there is a larger amount of vapour in the air, which produces

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

refraction of the sun's rays.</p>

<p><a id="question_536"></a>536. <i>Why does a red sunrise foretell wet?</i></p>

<p>Because it shows that <i>towards the East</i>, or dry quarter, the air is

has reached <i>saturation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_540"></a>540. <i>What is the difference between light and heat?</i></p>

<p>The most obvious distinction is, that light acts upon <i>vision</i>, and
heat upon <i>sensation</i>, or feeling.</p>

<p>Another distinction is, that <i>heat expands all bodies</i>, and alters
their atomic condition; while <i>light</i>, though usually attended by
heat, does not display the same expansive force, but produces various
effects which are <i>peculiar to itself</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_541"></a>541. <i>Are light and heat combined in the solar ray?</i></p>

<p>Yes. A ray of light, as well as containing elementary rays that
produce colours under refraction, contains also <i>chemical rays</i>, and
<i>heat rays</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_542"></a>542. <i>How do we know that light and heat are separate elements?</i></p>

<p>Because we have <i>heat rays</i>, as from dark hot iron, from various
chemical actions, and from friction, which are <i>unattended by the
development of light</i>. And we have light, or luminosity, such as
that of <i>phosophoresence</i>, which is unaccompanied by any appreciable
degree of heat.</p>

<p>But, besides this confirmation, further proof is afforded by the
fact, that in passing rays of solar light through media that are
<i>transparent to heat</i>, but not to <i>light</i>, the heat rays may be
<i>separated</i> from the luminous rays, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">Black glass, and black mica, which are nearly <i>opaque to light</i>,
are <i>transparent to heat</i> to the extent of ninety degrees out of
a hundred. While pale green glass, coloured by oxide of copper,
and covered with a coating of water, or a thin coating of alum,
will be perfectly <i>transparent to light</i>, but will be almost
quite <i>opaque to heat</i>. These remarks apply, in a greater or less
degree, to various other substances.</p>

<p><a id="question_543"></a>543. <i>In what respects are light and heat similar?</i></p>

<p>Both heat and light have been referred to minute vibratory motions
which occur, under exciting causes, in a very subtile elastic medium.</p>

<p>They are both united in the sun's rays.</p>

<p>They are both subject to laws of absorption, radiation, reflection,
and refraction.</p>

<p>They are both essential to life, whether animal or vegetable.</p>

<p>Both may be developed in their greatest intensity by electricity.</p>

<p>They are both imponderable.</p>

<p>Heat frequently exists without light.</p>

<p>Light is usually attended with heat.</p>

<p>Light may be instantly extinguished, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Heat can only be more
gradually reduced, by diffusion.</p>

<p>The solar rays deliver heat to the earth by day, and the heat remains
with the earth when the light has departed.</p>

<p>Heat diffuses itself in all directions.</p>

<p>Light travels only in straight lines.</p>

<p>The colours that absorb and radiate both light and heat do not act in
the same degree upon them both. Black, which does not radiate light,
is a good <i>radiator of heat</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The oxy-hydrogen <i>light</i> emits a most intense heat, but glass which
will transmit the rays of light, will afford no passage to the rays
of the <i>heat</i>.</p>

<p>Heat is latent in all bodies, but no satisfactory proof has been
found that light is latent in substances.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the analogies and distinctions that exist
between the two mysterious agents, light and heat. But they are
sufficient to supply the starting points of investigation.</p>

<p class="bq">The importance of the heat that attends the solar rays may be
illustrated by the experiments performed a few years ago, by
Mr. Baker, of Fleet-street, London, who made a large burning
lens, three feet and a half in diameter, and employed another
lens to reduce the rays of the first to a focus of half an inch
in diameter. The heat produced was so great that iron plates,
gold, and stones were <i>instantly melted</i>;
 and sulphur, pitch, and
resinous bodies, <i>were melted under water</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_545"></a>545. <i>What is the point of heat at which bodies become luminous?</i></p>

<p>The point of heat at which the eye begins to discover luminosity has
been estimated at 1,000 deg.</p>

<p><a id="question_546"></a>546. <i>What is the velocity of artificial light?</i></p>

<p>The light of a fire, or of a candle, or gas, travels with the same
velocity as the light of the sun,&mdash;a velocity which would convey
light eight times round the world while a person could count "one."</p>

<p><a id="question_547"></a>547. <i>At what rate of velocity does the light of the stars travel?</i></p>

<p>At the same velocity as all other light. And yet there are stars so
distant that, although the light of the sun reaches the earth in
eight minutes and a half, it requires <i>hundreds of years</i> to bring
their light to us.</p>

<p><a id="question_548"></a>548. <i>What is the relative intensity of primary and reflected light?</i></p>

<p>The intensity of a reflection depends upon the power of the
reflecting surface. But, taking the sun and moon as the great
examples of primary and reflected light, the intensity of the <i>sun's
light</i> is 801,072 times <i>greater than that of the moon</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_549"></a>549. <i>What is polarized light?</i></p>

<p><i>Polarized light</i> is light which has been subjected to <i>compound
refraction</i>, and which, after polarization, exhibits a new series
of phenomena, differing materially from those that pertain to the
primary conditions of light.</p>

<p><a id="question_550"></a>550. <i>What are the chief deductions from the phenomena observed under
the polarization of light?</i></p>

<p>The polarization of light appears to confirm in a high degree the
vibratory <i>theory of light</i>;
 and to show that the vibrations of light
have two planes or directions of motion. The mast of a ship, for
instance, has two motions: it progresses <i>vertically</i> as the ship is
impelled forward, and it rolls <i>laterally</i> through the motion of the
billows.</p>

<p>Something like this occurs in the vibrations of light, only the
<i>vertical vibration</i> is the condition of <i>one ray</i>, and the <i>lateral
vibration</i> is the condition of another ray, and the vibrations of
these two rays intersect each other in the solar ray. When these
vibrations occur together, the ray has certain properties and powers.
But by polarization the rays may be <i>separated</i>, and the result is
two distinct rays, having <i>different vibrations</i>.</p>

<p>It then appears that various bodies are transparent to these
polarized rays <i>only in certain directions</i>. And this fact is
supposed to show that bodies are made up of their atoms arranged
in certain planes, through or between which the <i>lateral</i> or the
<i>vertical</i> waves of light, together or singly, can or cannot pass;
and that the transparency or the opacity of a body is determined by
the <i>relation of its atomic planes</i> to <i>the planes of the vibrations
of light</i>.</p>

<p><i>Ordinary light</i>, passing through transparent media, produces no very
remarkable effect in its course; but <i>polarized light</i> appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
illuminate every atom of the permeated substance, and by surrounding
it with a prismatic clothing, to afford an illustration of its
<i>molecular arrangement</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_551"></a>551. <i>Why are two persons able to see each other?</i></p>

<p>Because rays of light <i>flow from their bodies to each other's eyes</i>,
and convey an impression of their respective conditions.</p>

<p class="bq">In some popular works that have come under our notice, we find
that the student is told that "we cannot absolutely see each
other&mdash;we only <i>see the rays of light reflected from each other</i>."
The statement is erroneous as expressed. We do not see the
<i>rays</i> of light, for if we did so, the effect of vision would
be destroyed, and all bodies would <i>appear</i> to be in a state of
<i>incandesence</i>, or of <i>phosphoresence</i>. Rays of light, which are
in themselves <i>invisible</i>, radiate from the objects we look upon,
enter the pupil of the eye, and impress the seat of vision in a
manner which conveys to the mind a knowledge of the form, colour,
and relative size and position of the figure we look upon. If
this is not seeing the object&mdash;<i>what is</i>? It would be just as
reasonable to say, that we cannot <i>hear</i> a person speak&mdash;that we
only hear the <i>vibrations of the air</i>. But as the vibrations are
imparted to the air by the organs of voice of the speaker, as he
sets the air in motion, and makes the air his messenger to us, we
certainly hear <i>him</i>, and can dispense with any logical myths that
confound the understanding, and contribute to no good result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="question_558"></a>558. <i>Why do plants become scorched under the unclouded sun?</i></p>

<p>Because the heat rays are in excess. The clouds shut off the
scorching light; but, like the blue glass of the photographer's
studio, they transmit <i>actinism</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_559"></a>559. <i>What effect has actinism upon vegetation?</i></p>

<p>It quickens the germination of seeds; and assists in the formation
of the colouring matter of leaves. Seeds and cuttings, which are
required to germinate quickly, will do so under the effect of blue
glass (which is equivalent to saying, the effect of an increased
proportion of <i>actinism</i>), in half the time they would otherwise
require.</p>

<p><a id="question_560"></a>560. <i>In what season of the year is the actinic power of light the
greatest?</i></p>

<p>In the <i>spring</i>, when the germination of plants demands its
vitalising aid. In <i>summer</i>, when the maturing process advances,
<i>light</i> and <i>heat</i> increase, and <i>actinism</i> relatively declines.
In the <i>autumn</i>, when the ripening period <i>arrives</i>, <i>light</i> and
<i>actinism</i> give way to a greater ratio of <i>heat</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">We shall have frequently, in the progress of our lessons, to refer
to <i>light</i> in its connection with the chemistry of nature, and
with organic life. But let us now invite the student to pause, and
for a moment contemplate the wonders of a sunbeam. How great is
its velocity&mdash;how vast its power&mdash;how varied its parts&mdash;yet how
ethereal! First, let us contemplate it as a simple beam in which
<i>light</i> and <i>heat</i> are associated. How deep the darkness of the
night, and how that darkness clings to the recesses of the earth.
But the day beams, and darkness flies before it, until every atom
that meets the face of day is lit up with radiance. That which
before lay buried in the shade of night is itself now a radiator
of the luminous fluid. Mark the genial warmth that comes as the
sister of light; then stand by the side of the experimentalist and
watch the point on which he directs the shining focus, and in an
instant see iron melt and stones run like water, under the fervent
heat! Now look upward to the heavens, where the falling drops of
rain have formed a natural prism in the rainbow, and shown that
the beam of pure whiteness, refracted into various rays, glows
with all the tints that adorn the garden of nature. These are the
visible effects of light. But follow it into the crust of the
earth, where it is, by another power, which is neither light nor
heat, quickening the seed into life; watch it as the germ springs
up, and the plant puts forth its tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
parts, touching them from
day to day with deeper dyes, until the floral picture is complete.
Follow it unto the sea, where it gives prismatic tints to the
<i>anemone</i>, and imparts the richest colours to the various <i>algae</i>.
Think of the millions of pictures that it paints daily upon the
eyes of living things. Contemplate the people of a vast city when,
attracted by some floating toy in the air, a million eyes look
up to watch its progress. The sun paints a million images of the
same object, and each observer has a perfect picture. It makes
common to all mankind the beauties of nature, and paints as richly
for the peasant as for the king. The Siamese twins were united
by a living cord which joined their systems, and gave unity and
sympathy to their sensations. In the great flood of light that
daily bathes the world, we have a bond of union, giving the like
pleasures and inspirations to millions of people at the same
instant. And that which floods the world with beauty, should no
less be a bond of unity and love.</p>

<p><a id="question_561"></a>561. <i>What is electricity?</i></p>

<p>Electricity is a property of <i>force</i> which resides in all matter, and
which constantly seeks to establish an <i>equilibrium</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_562"></a>562. <i>Why is it called electricity?</i></p>

<p>Because it first revealed itself to human observation through a
substance called, in the Greek language, <i>electrum</i>. This substance
is known to us as <i>amber</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_563"></a>563. <i>In what way did electrum induce attention to this property of
force in matter?</i></p>

<p>Thales, a Greek philosopher, observed that, by briskly rubbing
<i>electrum</i>, it acquired the property of <i>attracting</i> light particles
of matter, which moved towards the amber, and attached themselves to
its surface, evidently under the influence of a <i>force</i> excited in
the amber.</p>

<p><a id="question_564"></a>564. <i>What is amber?</i></p>

<p>It is a <i>resinous</i> substance, hard, bitter, tasteless, and glossy.
It has been variously supposed to be a vegetable gum, a fossil, and
an animal product. It is probably formed by a <i>species of ant</i> that
inhabit pine forests. The bodies of ants are frequently found in its
substance.</p>

<p><a id="question_565"></a>565. <i>Why does the rubbing of a stick of sealing-wax cause it to
attract small particles of matter?</i></p>

<p>Because it excites in the sealing wax that <i>force</i> which was first
observed in the <i>amber</i>. Sealing-wax, therefore, is called an
<i>electric</i> (<i>amber-like</i>) body.</p>

<p><a id="question_566"></a>566. <i>Why do we hear of the electric fluid?</i></p>

<p>Simply because the term <i>fluid</i> is the most convenient that can
be found to express our ideas when speaking of the <i>phenomena of
electric force</i>. But of the nature of electricity, except through its
observed <i>effects</i>, nothing is known.</p>

<p><a id="question_567"></a>567. <i>What substances are electric?</i></p>

<p>All substances in nature, from the <i>metals</i> to the <i>gases</i>. But they
differ very widely in their electrical qualities.</p>

<p><a id="question_568"></a>568. <i>What is positive electricity?</i></p>

<p>Electricity, when it exists, or is excited, in any body, to an amount
which is <i>in excess</i> of the amount natural to that body, is called
<i>positive</i> (called also <i>vitreous</i>).</p>

<p><a id="question_569"></a>569. <i>What is negative electricity?</i></p>

<p>Electricity, when it exists, or is excited, in any body, in an amount
which <i>is less</i> than is the amount natural to that body, is called
<i>negative</i> (called also <i>resinous</i>).</p>

<p><a id="question_570"></a>570. <i>Why is "positive" electricity called also "vitreous," and
"negative" electricity called also "resinous"?</i></p>

<p>Because some philosophers believe that there is but <i>one
electricity</i>, but that it is liable to variations of <i>quantity</i> or
<i>state</i>, which they distinguish by <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i>;
 while
other philosophers believe that there are <i>two electricities</i>, which
they name <i>vitreous</i> and <i>resinous</i>, because they may be induced
respectively from <i>vitreous</i> and <i>resinous</i> substances, and they
display forces of attraction and repulsion.</p>

<p><a id="question_571"></a>571. <i>Upon what do the electrical phenomena of nature depend?</i></p>

<p>Upon the tendency of <i>electricity</i> to find an <i>equilibrium</i> between
its <i>positive</i> and <i>negative</i> states (assuming there to be but <i>one</i>
fluid);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> or upon the tendency of <i>vitreous electricity</i> to seek out
and combine with <i>resinous electricity</i> (assuming that there are
<i>two</i> fluids).</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_572"></a>572. <i>How does the equilibrium of electricity become disturbed?</i></p>

<p>By changes in the condition of matter. As electricity resides in
all substances, and is, perhaps, an essential ingredient in their
condition, so every change in the state of matter&mdash;whether from
heat to cold, or from cold to heat; from a state of rest to that of
motion; from the solid to the liquid, or the æriform condition, or
<i>vice versa</i>;
 or whether substances combine chemically and produce
new compounds&mdash;in every change <i>the electrical equilibrium is
disturbed</i>;
 and, in proportion to the degree of disturbance, is the
force exerted by electricity to resume its balance in the scale of
nature.</p>

<p><a id="question_573"></a>573. <i>How does electricity seek to regain equilibrium?</i></p>

<p>By passing through substances that are favourable to its diffusion;
therefore they are called <i>conducting</i> or <i>non-conducting</i> bodies,
according as they favour or oppose the transmission of the electrical
current.</p>

<p><a id="question_574"></a>574. <i>What substances are conductors of electricity?</i></p>

<p>Metals, charcoal, animal fluids, water, vegetable bodies, animal
bodies, flame, smoke, vapour, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="question_575"></a>575. <i>What substances are non-conductors?</i></p>

<p>Rust, oils, phosphorous, lime, chalk, caoutchouc, gutta percha,
camphor, marble, porcelain, dry gases and air, feathers, hair, wool,
silk, glass, transparent stones, vitrefactions, wax, amber, &amp;c. These
bodies are also called <i>insulators</i>. Some of these substances, as
chalk, feathers, hair, wool, silk, &amp;c., though non-conductors when
<i>dry</i>, become conductors when <i>wetted</i>.</p>

<p class="bq"><i>Insulating</i>&mdash;preventing from escaping.</p>

<p><a id="question_576"></a>576. <i>Why are amber and wax classed among the non-conductors, when
they have been pointed out as electrics, and used to illustrate
electrical force?</i></p>

<p>It is <i>because</i> they are <i>non-conductors</i> that they have displayed,
under excitement, the attractive force shown in respect to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
particles of matter which were drawn towards their substances. If a
bar of <i>iron</i> were excited, instead of a stick of wax, electricity
would be equally developed; but the iron, <i>being a good conductor</i>,
would pass the electricity to the hand of the operator as fast as it
accumulated, and the equilibrium would be undisturbed.</p>

<p><a id="question_592"></a>592. <i>Why does lightning sometimes appear red, at others yellow, and

<p><a id="question_593"></a>593. <i>Does lightning ever pass upwards from the earth to the clouds?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_594"></a>594. <i>Does lightning ever pass directly from the clouds to the earth?</i></p>

<p>Yes; when the electricity of the clouds seeks to combine with the
<i>different electricity</i> of the earth.</p>

<p class="bq">The mingling of the electricities of the earth and the air must
be continually going on. But <i>lightning</i> does not attend the
phenomena, because all natural bodies, vapours, trees, animals,
mountains, houses, rocks, &amp;c., &amp;c., act more or less as conductors
between the earth and the air. It is only when there is a great
disturbance of the electrical forces, that <i>terrestrial lightning</i>
is developed. When lightning strikes the earth with great force,
it sometimes produces what are called <i>fulgurites</i> in sandy soils;
these are hollow tubes, produced by the melting of the soil.</p>

<p class="bq">The church alluded to was St. George's church, Leicester, a new
edifice, which was completely destroyed on the 1st of August,
1846, by a thunder-storm. The steeple was rent asunder, and
massive stones were hurled to a distance of thirty feet. The
vane rod and top part of the spire fell down perpendicularly and
carried with it all the floors of the tower. A similar disaster
occurred to St. Bride's church, Fleet-street, London, about 100
years ago. The lightning first struck upon the metal vane of the
steeple, and then ran down the rod and attacked the iron cramps,
smashing the large stones that lay between them. The church was
nearly destroyed. By the same wonderful force, ships have been
disabled, trees split asunder, houses thrown down, and animals
struck dead.</p>

<p><a id="question_596"></a>596. <i>Why is it dangerous to stand near a tree during an electric
storm?</i></p>

<p>Because the tree is a <i>better conductor than air</i>, and electricity
would probably strike the tree, and then pass to the person standing
near.</p>

<p><a id="question_597"></a>597. <i>If trees are good conductors, why do they not convey the
electricity to the ground?</i></p>

<p>Trees are only <i>indifferent conductors</i>, and the electricity would
quit the tree to pass through any <i>better conductor</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_598"></a>598. <i>Why is it dangerous to sit near a fire during an electric
storm?</i></p>

<p>Because the chimney, being <i>a tall object</i>, and smoke a <i>good
conductor</i>, would probably attract the electricity, and convey it to
the body of a person sitting near the fire.</p>

<p><a id="question_599"></a>599. <i>Why is it dangerous to be near water during an electric storm?</i></p>

<p>Because water is a <i>good conductor</i>, and the vapour arising from it
might attract the electricity. Man, <i>being elevated over the water</i>,
might form the first point attacked by the electricity.</p>

<p><a id="question_600"></a>600. <i>Are iron houses dangerous during an electric storm?</i></p>

<p>No; they are <i>very safe</i>, because their entire surface is a good

<p><a id="question_601"></a>601. <i>Why does electricity seize upon bell wires and iron fastenings?</i></p>

<p>Because copper wires are the <i>very best</i> conductors of electricity;
and iron articles are also good conductors.</p>

<p><a id="question_602"></a>602. <i>Supposing electricity to attack a bell wire, where would the
point of danger exist?</i></p>

<p>At the <i>extremities of the wire</i>, where the conducting power of the
wire would cease, and the electricity would seek to find <i>another
conductor</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_603"></a>603. <i>Are umbrellas, with steel frames, dangerous in an electric
storm?</i></p>

<p>They are dangerous <i>in some degree</i>, because they might convey
electricity to the hand, and then transfer it to the body. But,
generally speaking, when it rains, the rain itself, <i>being a good
conductor</i>, relieves the disturbance of electricity by conveying it
to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="question_604"></a>604. <i>Are iron bedsteads dangerous in electric storms?</i></p>

<p>No, they are safe, because the iron frame, completely surrounding the
body, and having <i>a great capacity for conduction</i>, would keep the
electricity away from the body.</p>

<p><a id="question_605"></a>605. <i>Why is it safe to be in bed during an electric storm?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>feathers</i>, <i>hair</i>, <i>wool</i>, <i>cotton</i>, &amp;c., especially when
dry, are good <i>insulators</i> or <i>non-conductors</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_606"></a>606. <i>What is the safest situation to be in during an electric storm?</i></p>

<p>In the centre of a room, <i>isolated</i> as far as possible from
surrounding objects; sitting on a chair, and avoiding handling any of
the conducting substances. The windows and doors should be closed, to
prevent <i>drafts of air</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>To keep aloof, as far as possible, from elevated structures;
and regard the rain, though it might saturate our clothes, as a
protection against the lightning stroke, for <i>wet clothes</i> would
supply so <i>good a conductor</i>, that a large amount of electricity
would pass over man's body, through wet garments, and he would be
quite unconscious of it.</p>

<p class="bq">During a violent electric storm in the Shetland Islands, a fishing
boat was attacked by the electric fluid, which tore the mast to
shivers. A fisherman was sitting by the side of the mast at the
time, but he felt no shock. Upon taking out his watch, however, he
found that the electric current had actually fused his watch into
a mass. In this case, it is more than probable that the man was
saved through the saturation of his clothes with rain.</p>

<p><a id="question_608"></a>608. <i>Do lightning conductors "attract" electricity?</i></p>

<p>Not unless the electric current lies in their vicinity.</p>

<p><a id="question_609"></a>609. <i>Why have lightning conductors sometimes been found ineffective?</i></p>

<p>Because they have been unskilfully constructed; have been too small
in their dimensions, and have not been properly laid to convey the
electricity harmlessly away.</p>

<p><a id="question_610"></a>610. <i>What is the best metal for a lightning conductor?</i></p>

<p><i>Copper</i>, the conducting power of which is <i>five times greater than
that of iron</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_611"></a>611. <i>Why should a large building have several conductors?</i></p>

<p>Because the influence of a conductor over the electricity of the
surrounding air does not extend to more than a radius of double the
height of the conductor above the building: for instance, a conductor
rising <i>ten feet high</i> above the building would influence the
electricity <i>twenty feet all round the conductor</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_612"></a>612. <i>Why should conductors have at their base several branches
penetrating the earth?</i></p>

<p>To facilitate the discharge of the <i>accumulated electricity</i> into the
earth.</p>

<p><a id="question_613"></a>613. <i>Why does electricity affect the shapes of clouds?</i></p>

<p>Because electricity does not penetrate the <i>masses</i> of <i>bodies</i>, but
affects generally <i>their surfaces</i>. Hence electricity exists in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
<i>surfaces of clouds</i>, and in its efforts to <i>find an equilibrium</i> it
causes the clouds to roll in <i>heavy masses</i>, having dark outlines.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">The fact that electricity resides in, and is conducted by, the
<i>surfaces</i> of bodies, is well established, and should receive due
attention in the protective measures adopted to secure life and
property against the effects of lightning. A practical suggestion
that arises out of this fact is, that <i>tubes of copper</i> would
form far more efficient conductors than <i>bars</i> of the same metal.
A <i>copper tube</i>, of half an inch diameter, would conduct <i>nearly
double</i> the amount of electricity which could be conveyed away by
a <i>bar</i> of copper of the same diameter. The upper extremity of the
tube should be open obliquely, that the electric current might be
induced to pass over <i>both the inner and outer surfaces</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_614"></a>614. <i>What is thunder?</i></p>

<p>Thunder is the <i>noise which succeeds the rush</i> of the electrical
fluid through the air.</p>

<p><a id="question_615"></a>615. <i>Why does noise follow the commotion caused by electricity?</i></p>

<p>Because, by the violence of the electric force, vast <i>fields of air
are divided</i>;
 great volumes of air are <i>rarefied</i>;
 and <i>vapours</i> are
<i>condensed</i>, and thrown down as <i>rain</i>. Thunder is therefore caused
by the <i>vibrations of the air</i>, as it collapses, and seeks to restore
its own <i>equilibrium</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_616"></a>616. <i>Why is the thunder-peal sometimes loud and continuous?</i></p>

<p>Because the electrical discharge takes place near the hearer, and
therefore the vibrations of the air are heard in their full power.</p>

<p><a id="question_617"></a>617. <i>Why is the thunder-peal sometimes broken and unequal?</i></p>

<p>Because the electrical discharge takes place at a <i>considerable
distance</i>, and the vibrations are affected in their course by
<i>mountains</i> and <i>valleys</i>. Because, also, the <i>forked arms</i> of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
lightning strike out in different directions, causing the sounds of
thunder to reach us from <i>varying distances</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Lo, these are parts of his ways; but how little
a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can
understand?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Job xxv.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_618"></a>618. <i>Why has the thunder-peal sometimes a low grumbling noise?</i></p>

<p>Because the electrical discharges, though violent, take place <i>far
away</i>, and the vibrations of the air <i>become subdued</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_619"></a>619. <i>Why does the thunder-peal sometimes follow immediately after
the flash of lightning?</i></p>

<p>Because the discharge of electricity takes place near the hearer.</p>

<p><a id="question_620"></a>620. <i>Why does the thunder-peal sometimes occur several seconds after
the flash?</i></p>

<p>Because the discharge takes place far away, and <i>light</i> travels with
a much greater velocity than <i>sound</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_621"></a>621. <i>Through what distance will the sound of thunder travel?</i></p>

<p>Some <i>twenty or thirty miles</i>, according to the <i>direction of the
wind</i>, and the violence of the peal.</p>

<p><a id="question_622"></a>622. <i>Through what distance will the light of lightning travel?</i></p>

<p>The <i>light</i> of lightning, and its reflections, will penetrate through
a distance of from <i>a hundred and fifty to two hundred miles</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_623"></a>623. <i>How may we calculate the distance at which the electric
discharge takes place?</i></p>

<p>Sound travels at the rate of <i>a quarter of a mile in a second</i>. If,
therefore, the peal of thunder is heard <i>four seconds</i> after the
flash of lightning, the discharge took place about a mile off. The
pulse of an adult person beats about <i>once in a second</i>;
 therefore,
guided by the pulse, any person may calculate the probable distance
of the storm:&mdash;</p>

<p class="ml-40">2 beats, &frac12; a mile.<br />
3 beats, &frac34; of a mile.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
4 beats, 1 mile.<br />
5 beats, 1&frac14; miles.<br />
6 beats, 1&frac12; miles.<br />
7 beats, 1&frac34; miles.<br />
8 beats, 2 miles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Attention should be paid to the <i>direction and speed of the wind</i>,
and some modifications of the calculation be made accordingly.
Persons between 20 and 40 years of age should count <i>five beats of
the pulse to a mile</i>;
 under 20, <i>six beats</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_624"></a>624. <i>Why are electric storms more frequent in hot than in cold
weather?</i></p>

<p>Because of the <i>greater evaporation</i>, as the effect of heat; and also
of the <i>effect of heat</i> upon the particles of all bodies.</p>

<p><a id="question_625"></a>625. <i>Why do electric storms frequently occur after a duration of dry
weather?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>dry air</i>, being a bad conductor, prevents the <i>opposite
electricities</i> from finding their <i>equilibrium</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_626"></a>626. <i>Why is a flash of lightning generally succeeded by heavy rain?</i></p>

<p>Because the electrical discharge destroys the <i>vescicles</i> of the
vapours. If a number of <i>small soap-bubbles</i> floating in the air were
<i>suddenly broken</i> by a violent commotion of the atmosphere, the <i>thin
films</i> of the bubbles would form <i>drops of water</i>, and fall <i>like
rain</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_627"></a>627. <i>Why is an electrical discharge usually followed by a gust of
wind?</i></p>

<p>Because the equilibrium of the atmosphere is disturbed by the <i>heat
and velocity of lightning</i>, and the <i>condensation of vapour</i>. Air,
therefore, rushes towards those parts where a degree of <i>vacuity</i> or
<i>rarefaction</i> has been produced.</p>

<p><a id="question_628"></a>628. <i>What is a thunderbolt?</i></p>

<p>The name <i>thunderbolt</i> is applied to an electrical discharge, when

<p><a id="question_629"></a>629. <i>Why do electric storms purify the air?</i></p>

<p>Because they restore the <i>equilibrium of electricity</i> which is
essential to the salubrity of the atmosphere; they intermix the
<i>gases of the atmosphere</i>, by agitation; they <i>precipitate the
vapours</i> of the atmosphere, and with the precipitation of vapours,
<i>noxious exhalations</i> are taken to the earth, where they become
absorbed; they also contribute largely to the formation of <i>ozone</i>,
which imparts to the air corrective and restorative properties.</p>

<p><a id="question_630"></a>630. <i>What is ozone?</i></p>

<p>Ozone is an <i>atmospheric element</i> recently discovered, and respecting
which differences of opinion prevail. It is generally supposed to be
<i>oxygen</i> in a state <i>of great strength</i>, constituting a variety of
form or condition.</p>

<p><a id="question_631"></a>631. <i>Why do we know that electricity contributes to the formation of
ozone?</i></p>

<p>Because careful observations have established the fact that the
proportion of <i>ozone</i> in the atmosphere is <i>relative to the amount of
electricity</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_632"></a>632. <i>What are the properties of ozone?</i></p>

<p>It displays an extraordinary power in the neutralisation of
putrefactions, rapidly and thoroughly counteracting noxious
exhalations; it is the most powerful of all <i>disinfectants</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">Schonbien, the discoverer of <i>ozone</i>, inclines to the opinion
that it is a <i>new chemical element</i>. Whatever it may be, there
can be no doubt that it plays an important part in the economy of
nature. Its <i>absence</i> has been marked by pestilential ravages, as
in the <i>cholera</i> visitations; and to its <i>excess</i> are attributed
epidemics, such as <i>influenza</i>. It was found, during the last
visitation of cholera, that the <i>fumigation of houses with
sulphur</i> had a remarkable efficacy in preventing the spread of
the contagion. The combustion of sulphur ozonised the atmosphere;
the same result occurs through the emission of <i>phosphoric
vapours</i>;
 ozone is also developed by the electricity evolved by
the <i>electrical machine</i>, and in the greater <i>electrical phenomena
of nature</i>. The smell imparted to the air during an electric
storm is identical with that which occurs in the vicinity of an
electrical apparatus&mdash;it is a <i>fresh</i> and <i>sulphurous</i> odour. The
opinion is gaining ground that the respiration of animals and the
combustion of matter are sources of ozone, and that plants produce
it when under the influence of the direct rays of the sun. It is
also believed to be produced by water, when the sun's rays fall
upon it. The most recent opinion respecting ozone is, that it is
<i>electrized oxygen</i>. The subject is of vast importance, and opens
another field of discovery to the pioneers of scientific truth.</p>

the theory of Galvani.</p>

<p><a id="question_637"></a>637. <i>What are the differences between mechanical, or frictional
electricity, Voltaic electricity, Galvanism, and magnetism?</i></p>

<p><i>Frictional</i> electricity is electricity <i>suddenly</i> liberated under
the effects of the <i>motion</i>, or the mechanical disturbance of bodies.</p>

<p><i>Voltaic</i> electricity is a <i>steady flow</i> of an electric current,
arising from the <i>gradual changes</i> of <i>chemical</i> phenomena.</p>

<p><i>Galvanism</i> and <i>Voltaism</i> are almost <i>identical</i>, since the latter

<p class="bq">Man knows not <i>what electricity is</i>;
 yet, by an attentive
observance of its <i>effects</i>, he avails himself of the power
existing in an unknown source, and produces marvellous results.
When the Grecian philosopher, Thales, sat rubbing a piece of
amber, and watching the attraction of small particles of matter
to its surface, he little knew of the mighty power that was then
whispering to him its offer to serve mankind. And when Franklin,
with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
aid of a boy's plaything, drew down an electric current
from the clouds, and caught a spark upon the knuckles of his hand,
<i>even he</i> little conjectured that the time was so near when that
strange element, which sent its messenger to him along the string
of a kite, would become one of man's most submissive servants.</p>

<p class="bq">So many great results have sprung from the careful observation
of the simplest phenomena, that we should never pass over
inattentively the most trifling thing that offers itself to our
examination. Nature, in her revelations, never seeks to <i>startle</i>
mankind. The formation of a rock, and the elaboration of a truth,
are alike the work of ages. It was the simple blackening of silver
by the sun's rays which led to the discovery of the <i>chemical
agency of light</i>. It was the falling of an apple which pointed
Newton to the discovery of the <i>laws of gravitation</i>. It was the
force of steam, observed as it issued from beneath the lid of a
kettle, that led to the invention of the <i>steam-engine</i>. And it is
said of Jacquard, that he <i>invented the loom</i> which so materially
aided the commerce of nations, while watching the motions of his
<i>wife's fingers</i>, as she plied her knitting. As great discoveries
spring from such small beginnings, who among us may not be the
herald of some great truth&mdash;the founder of some world-wide
benefaction?</p>

<p class="bq">That the area of discovery has not perceptibly narrowed its
limits, is evident from the fact that the greatest elements in
nature are still mysteries to man. And though it may not be within
the power of a finite being to unravel the chain of wonders that
enfold the works of an infinite God,&mdash;still it is evident, from
the progress which discovery has made, and from the good which
discovery has done, that God <i>does</i> invite and encourage the human
mind to contemplate the workings of Divine power, and to pursue
its manifestations in every element, and in every direction.</p>

<p class="bq">The wonderful force of <i>electricity</i> astonishes us all the more
when we view it in contrast with that equally wonderful element,
<i>light</i>. We have seen that light travels with a velocity of
192,000 miles in a second, but that it falls upon a delicate
balance so gently, that it produces no perceptible effect. As far
as we know the nature of <i>electricity</i>, it is even <i>more ethereal</i>
than <i>light</i>;
 yet, while the <i>ether of light</i> falls harmlessly and
imperceptibly&mdash;even with the momentum of a flight of <i>ninety-five
millions of miles</i>, the <i>ether of electricity</i>, bursting from
a cloud only <i>five hundred yards</i> distant, will split massive
stones, level tall towers with the dust, strike majestic trees
to the ground, and instantly extinguish the life of man! <i>Why</i>
does <i>the one ether</i> come divested of all mechanical force, while
that which seems to be <i>even more ethereal</i> than it, is capable
of exerting the mightiest force over material things? Does it not
appear that the Creator of the universe has established these
paradoxes of power to testify his Omnipotence&mdash;to show to man that
with Him all things are possible; and that, in the grand cosmicism
of the universe, every attribute of Omnipotence has been fulfilled?</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And the seventh angel poured out his vial
into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of
heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rev. xvi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Let us now consider man's relation to this Omnipotence. He sees
that electricity smites the tall edifice, and observes that in
doing so it displays a choice of a certain substance through
which it passes harmlessly, and that its violence is manifested
only when its path is interrupted. Man, taking advantage of this
preference of electricity for a particular conductor, stretches
out an arm of that substance, and points it upwards to the
clouds; electricity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
accepts the invitation, and passes harmlessly
to the earth. But this not all: man learns by observation that
electricity resides in all matter; that it may be collected or
dispersed; that it travels along a good conductor at the rate
of <i>half-a-million of miles in a second of time</i>;
 he constructs
a battery, a kind of scientific fortress, in which he encamps
the great warrior of nature; and then, laying down a conducting
wire, he liberates the mighty force: but its flight must be on
the path which man has defined, and its journey must cease at the
terminus which man has decreed, where, by a simple contrivance of
his ingenuity (the movements of a magnetic needle), the electric
current is made to deliver whatever message of importance he
desires to convey. Thus, the element which in an instant might
deprive man of life, is subdued by him, and made the obedient
messenger of his will.</p>

<p><a id="question_639"></a>639. <i>To what height does the atmosphere extend?</i></p>

<p>It is estimated to extend to from <i>forty to fifty miles</i> above the
surface of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="question_640"></a>640. <i>Why is it supposed that the atmosphere does not extend beyond
that height?</i></p>

<p>Because it is found, by experiment and observation, that the air
becomes <i>less dense</i> in proportion to its altitude from the earth's
surface. The gradual decrease of atmospheric density observed in
ascending a mountain, or in a balloon, supplies sufficient data to
enable us to calculate the height at which the atmosphere would
probably <i>altogether cease</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">At an altitude of 18,000 feet the air is indicated by the
barometer to be only <i>half as dense</i> as at the surface of
the earth. And as the densities of the atmosphere decrease
in a geometrical progression, the density will be reduced to
<i>one-fourth</i> at the height of 36,000 feet; and to <i>one-eighth</i>
at 54,000 feet. The effects of the decreasing density of the
atmosphere are, that the <i>intensity of light and sound are
diminished, and the temperature is lowered</i>. Persons who have
reached a very high elevation, state that the sky above them began
to assume the appearance of darkness; and there can be no doubt
that, if it were possible to reach an altitude of some fifty to
sixty miles, there would be <i>perfect blackness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
although the sun's
rays might be pouring through the darkened space</i>, to illuminate
the atmosphere. Upon the summit of Mont Blanc, the report of a
pistol at a short distance can <i>scarcely be heard</i>. When Gay
Lussac reached the height of 23,000 feet, he breathed with great
pain and difficulty, and felt distressing sensations in his ears,
as though they were <i>about to burst</i>. Upon the high table-lands of
Peru, the lips of Dr. Ischudi cracked and burst; and blood flowed
from his eyelids.</p>

<p><a id="question_641"></a>641. <i>What is the amount of atmospheric pressure at the earth's
surface?</i></p>

<p>The pressure of the atmosphere at the earth's surface is <i>fifteen
pounds</i> to every square inch of surface. That is to say, that the
column of air, extending fifty miles over a square inch of the earth,
presses upon that square inch with a weight equal to <i>fifteen pounds</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_642"></a>642. <i>Is that the weight of dry or moist air?</i></p>

<p>That is the weight of air at what is called the <i>point of
saturation</i>, when it is fully charged with <i>watery vapour</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_643"></a>643. <i>What is the proportion of watery vapour in the atmosphere?</i></p>

<p>The proportion <i>constantly varies</i>. Evaporation is not a result of
accident; it seems an <i>established law</i> that the air shall constantly
<i>absorb vapour</i> until it has reached the maximum that it can hold.
Experiments have been tried, in which dry air has been pressed upon
the surface of water with great force, <i>but no degree of pressure
could prevent the formation of vapour</i>. (<i>See</i> <a href="#question_431">431</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="question_644"></a>644. <i>What is the total amount of atmospheric pressure on the earth's
surface?</i></p>

<p>The total amount of atmospheric pressure on the earth's surface, at
15 lbs. to the square inch, amounts to 12,042,604,800,000,000,000
lbs. This pressure is equal to that of a globe of lead of <i>sixty
miles in diameter</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_645"></a>645. <i>What is the pressure of the atmosphere upon the human body?</i></p>

<p>Estimating the surface of man's body to be equal to <i>fifteen square
feet</i>, he sustains an atmospheric pressure of 32,400 lbs., or nearly
<i>fourteen tons and a-half</i>. The mere <i>variation of weight</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> arising
out of the changes in the state of the atmosphere, may amount to as
much as a <i>ton and a-half</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_646"></a>646. <i>Why does not man feel this pressure?</i></p>

<p>Because the diffusion of air which, <i>surrounding him in every
direction</i>, and acting upon the <i>internal</i> as well as the <i>external</i>
surfaces of his body, and probably <i>surrounding every atom of his
frame</i>, establishes an equilibrium, in which every degree of pressure
<i>counteracts and sustains itself</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_647"></a>647. <i>What is the weight of air relative to that of water?</i></p>

<p>A cubic foot of air weighs only 523 grains, a little more than <i>an
ounce</i>;
 a cubic foot of water weighs <i>one thousand ounces</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_648"></a>648. <i>What is the greatest height in the atmosphere which any human
being has ever reached?</i></p>

<p>M. Gay Lussac, in the year 1804, ascended to the height of 23,000
feet.</p>

<p><a id="question_649"></a>649. <i>What is a vacuum?</i></p>

<p>A vacuum is a space <i>devoid of matter</i>. The term is generally applied
to those instances in which air is drawn from within an air-tight
vessel.</p>

<p><a id="question_650"></a>650. <i>Is it possible to form a perfect vacuum?</i></p>

<p>It is probably <i>impossible to do so</i>, even with the most powerful
instruments&mdash;some portion of air would remain, but in so thin a form
that it would be <i>imperceptible</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_651"></a>651. <i>Why does the depression of a pump-handle cause the water to
flow?</i></p>

<p>Because the putting down of the handle lifts up the piston with its
<i>valve closed</i>, thereby tending to produce a <i>vacuum</i>;
 but <i>the
pressure of the air</i> upon the water <i>not contained in the pump</i>,
forces more water up into the part where a <i>vacuum</i> would otherwise
be formed. Then, when the handle is raised, and the piston forced
downwards, <i>the valve opens</i>, and the water rushes through.</p>

<p>There is a second valve, below the piston, which closes with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
downward movement, to prevent the water from <i>rushing back again.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_652"></a>652. <i>How high will atmospheric pressure raise water in the bore of a
pump?</i></p>

<p>It will raise water to an elevation of <i>thirty feet</i> above its level.</p>

<p><a id="question_653"></a>653. <i>Why will it raise water to an elevation of thirty-feet?</i></p>

<p>Because a column of water of <i>thirty feet high</i>, nearly balances the
weight of <i>a column of air</i> of equal surface, <i>extending to the whole
height of the atmosphere</i>. When, therefore, water is elevated to the
height of thirty feet, the power of the pump is enfeebled, as the air
and the water <i>balance each other</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_654"></a>654. <i>How is water raised to a greater elevation when it is required?</i></p>

<p>By mechanical contrivances, by which the water is <i>forced</i> to a
greater elevation.</p>

<p><a id="question_655"></a>655. <i>Why does water run through the bent tube called a syphon?</i></p>

<p>Because the atmospheric pressure upon the water on <i>the outside of
the syphon</i> forces it into the tube as fast as the syphon empties
itself through its longer arm.</p>

<p><a id="question_656"></a>656. <i>Why does water run through the longer arm of the syphon?</i></p>

<p>Because the weight of the water in the longer arm of the syphon <i>is
greater than that in the shorter</i>;
 therefore it runs out by its own
gravity. And, as in running out, it creates a tendency towards a
<i>vacuum</i>, the pressure of the outer air comes into operation, and
forces the water through the tube.</p>

<p><a id="question_657"></a>657. <i>Why does water issue from the earth in springs?</i></p>

<p>Some springs are caused by <i>natural syphons</i> formed in the fissures
of rocks, which, communicating with bodies of water, are continually
filled by atmospheric pressure, and therefore convey streams of water
to the point where they are set free.</p>

<p>Because the pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of the card
counteracts the weight of the water.</p>

<p><a id="question_659"></a>659. <i>What has the card to do with the experiment?</i></p>

<p>It forms <i>a base</i> upon which the water may rest, while the glass
is being inverted; and it prevents the air from acting upon the
<i>fluidity</i> of the water, and forcing it out of the glass.</p>

<p><a id="question_660"></a>660. <i>Why will not beer run out of the tap of a cask until a spile
has been driven in at the top?</i></p>

<p>Because the pressure of the air upon the opening of the tap
counteracts the weight of the beer. But when the spile is driven in,
the air enters at the top, <i>and counteracts its own pressure at the
bottom</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_661"></a>661. <i>Why does a cup in a pie become filled with juice?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>the heat expands the air</i>, and drives nearly all of it
out of the cup. When the pie is taken out of the oven, and begins
to cool, air cannot get into the cup again, because its edges are
surrounded by juice. A <i>partial vacuum</i>, therefore, exists within the
cup, and the pressure of the external air <i>forces the juice into it</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_662"></a>662. <i>Does the cup prevent the juice from boiling over?</i></p>

<p>No. So long as the <i>heat</i> exists, the cup remains <i>empty</i>;
 and as it
occupies space, the air is driven out of it, into the pie, it rather
tends to force the juice over the sides of the dish. It is only <i>when
cooling</i> that the juice enters the cup.</p>

<p><a id="question_663"></a>663. <i>Why can flies walk on the ceiling?</i></p>

<p>Because their feet are so formed that they can form a <i>vacuum</i>,

gravitation by <i>atmospheric pressure</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_664"></a>664. <i>How did Mr. Sands perform the feat of walking across the
ceiling?</i></p>

<p>By having large discs of wet leather attached to his feet, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
when they were placed upon a smooth surface, the air was excluded,
and when he allowed his weight to act upon one of the discs, it
formed a <i>hollow cup</i> and a <i>vacuum</i>. By forming a vacuum of only
<i>twelve square inches</i> he gained a pressure of 180 lbs.; this being
more than his weight he could accomplish the feat with no other
difficulty than that of remaining in an inverted position. The air
was admitted underneath the discs by valves, which were closed by
springs, which being pressed by the heels of the performer, let in
the air, and <i>set the feet free</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>breeze</i> travels ten feet in a second; a <i>light gale</i>, sixteen feet

feet in a second; <i>hurricane</i> of the torrid zone, one hundred and
twenty to three hundred feet in a second. When wind flies at one mile

<p><a id="question_668"></a>668. <i>What are trade winds?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Trade winds are vast currents of air, which <i>sweep round the globe</i>
over a belt of some 12,000 miles in width.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"They shall be as the morning cloud, and as
the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven
with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
chimney."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hosea xiii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_669"></a>669. <i>What is the cause of trade winds?</i></p>

<p>The air over the tropical regions becomes heated and ascends; it
then diverges in two high currents, one towards the north, and
the other towards the south pole, where, being cooled, it again
descends, and returns towards the equator to replace the air as it
ascends therefrom. There is, therefore, a constant revolution of vast
currents of air between the tropics and the poles, producing <i>north
and south winds</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_670"></a>670. <i>Why do the trade winds blow from east to west, though, in their
origin, their direction is from north to south and from south to
north?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the north and south winds blow towards the equator, they
are affected by the revolution of the earth from <i>west to east</i>. As
the two winds from the poles approach the equator, they are gradually
diverted from their northerly and southerly course, to an easterly
direction, by the revolution of the earth.</p>

<p><a id="question_671"></a>671. <i>Why is there a prevalence of calms at the equator?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the north and the south winds move towards the equator,
they drive before them volumes of atmosphere, which, meeting in
opposite directions, resist and counterpoise each other, and abide in
a state of stillness between the north and south-easterly winds, one
on the north and the other on the south of the equator.</p>

<p><a id="question_672"></a>672. <i>What are monsoons?</i></p>

<p>Monsoons are <i>periodical winds</i> which blow at a given period of the
year from one quarter of the compass, and in another period of the
year from the opposite quarter of the compass.</p>

<p><a id="question_673"></a>673. <i>What is the cause of monsoons?</i></p>

<p>Monsoons are caused by changes in the position of the sun. When the
sun is in the southern hemisphere, it produces a <i>north-east wind</i>,
and when it is in the northern hemisphere, a <i>north-west wind</i>. The
north-east monsoon blows from November to March,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> and the south-west
monsoon from the end of April to the middle of October. The region
of monsoons lies a little to the north of the northern border of the
trade wind, and they blow with the greatest force, and with most
regularity, between the eastern coast of Africa and Hindustan.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_674"></a>674. <i>What determines the character of winds?</i></p>

<p>The character of winds is influenced by the condition of <i>the
surfaces over which they blow</i>. Winds blowing over dry and arid
plains and deserts are <i>dry and hot</i>. Winds blowing across
snow-capped mountains and regions of ice are <i>cold</i>. Winds that cross
oceans are <i>wet</i>;
 and those that cross extensive continents are <i>dry</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_675"></a>675. <i>What winds are most prevalent in England?</i></p>

<p>In England out of a <i>thousand days</i>, north winds prevail in 82;

225; west, 171; north-west, 120.</p>

<p><a id="question_676"></a>676. <i>What is the cause of storms?</i></p>

<p>Storms result from violent commotions of the atmosphere, and are
chiefly the result of extreme <i>changes of temperature</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>magnetic</i> state of the earth, and the <i>electrical</i> state of the
atmosphere, also materially influence the phenomena of storms.</p>

<p>By some persons the theory is entertained that storms result from
various winds <i>rushing into a centre</i> in which the atmosphere has
become extremely condensed. According to this theory, a storm is a
mighty whirlwind.</p>

<p class="bq">A most violent hurricane occurred in 1780, which destroyed Lord
Rodney's fleet, and a vast number of merchant ships. It is said to
have killed 9,000 persons in Martinique alone, and 6,000 in St.
Lucia. The town of St. Pierre in Martinique was totally destroyed;
and only fourteen houses in the town of Kingston, in St. Vincent,
were left uninjured.</p>

<p><a id="question_677"></a>677. <i>Why do the most violent storms occur in and near the tropics?</i></p>

<p>Because there the temperature is very high, and the cold currents
of air rushing towards the equator from the poles, causes great
<i>atmospheric disturbance</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_678"></a>678. <i>What are whirlwinds?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Whirlwinds are produced by violent and contrary currents meeting
and striking upon each other, producing <i>a circular motion</i>. They
generally occur after long calms, attended by much heat.</p>

<p>Whirlwinds occurring at sea, or over the surface of water, sometimes
put the water in motion, and as the wind rises upwards it lifts with
it a whirling mass of water, producing a <i>water spout</i>.</p>

there is, consequently, less difference of weight between the warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

<p><a id="question_683"></a>683. <i>Why do some chimneys smoke when the doors and windows are

<p><a id="question_686"></a>686. <i>Why do chimneys that stand under elevated objects, such as
hills, trees, and high buildings, smoke?</i></p>

and a part of it <i>rushes downward</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_687"></a>687. <i>Why do sooty chimneys smoke?</i></p>

<p>Because the accumulation of the soot <i>diminishes the size of the
flue</i>, and lessens the ascensive power of the draught, by reducing
the quantity of <i>warm air</i>. It also obstructs the motion of the air,
by the <i>roughness of its surface</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_688"></a>688. <i>Why do chimneys smoke in damp and gusty weather?</i></p>

<p>Because the ascending air is <i>suddenly chilled</i> by gusts of damp and

<p><a id="question_690"></a>690. <i>Why do the wings of wind-mills turn round?</i></p>

<p>Because the wind, striking <i>at an angle</i> upon the wings, forces them

upon the same centre, the <i>oblique pressure</i> of the wind causes the
centre to rotate.</p>

<p><a id="question_691"></a>691. <i>What is a barometer?</i></p>

<p>A barometer is an instrument which <i>indicates the pressure of the
atmosphere</i>, and which takes its name from two Greek words signifying
<i>measurer of weight</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_692"></a>692. <i>Why does a barometer indicate the pressure of the atmosphere?</i></p>

<p>Because it consists of a tube containing <i>quicksilver</i>, closed at one
end and open at the other, so that the pressure of the air upon the
open end balances the weight of the column of mercury (quicksilver),
and when the pressure of the air upon the open surface of the mercury
increases or decreases, the mercury <i>rises or falls</i> in response
thereto.</p>

<p><a id="question_693"></a>693. <i>Why is a barometer called also a "weather-glass"?</i></p>

<p>Because changes in the weather are generally preceded by <i>alterations
in the atmospheric pressure</i>. But we cannot perceive those changes
as they gradually occur; the alteration in the height of the column
of mercury, therefore, enables us to know that atmospheric changes
are taking place, and, by observation, we are enabled to determine
certain rules by which <i>the state of the weather may be foretold</i>
with considerable probability.</p>

<p><a id="question_694"></a>694. <i>Why are barometers constructed with circular dials, and an
index to denote changes?</i></p>

<p>Because that is a convenient mechanical arrangement, by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> the
alterations of the relative pressures of the air and the mercury are
<i>more clearly denoted than by an inspection of the mercury itself.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_695"></a>695. <i>Why does the hand of the weather dial change its position when
the column of mercury rises or falls?</i></p>

<p>Because a weight, which <i>floats upon the open surface of the
mercury</i>, is attached to a string, having a nearly equal weight at
the other extremity; the string is laid over a revolving pivot to
which the hand is fixed, and <i>the friction of the string turns the
hand, as the mercury rises or falls</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_696"></a>696. <i>Why does tapping the face of the barometer sometimes cause the
hand to move?</i></p>

<p>Because the weight on the surface of the mercury frequently <i>leans
against the sides of the tube</i>, and does not move freely. And,
also, the mercury clings to the sides of the tube by <i>capillary
attraction</i>;
 therefore, tapping on the face of the barometer <i>sets
the weight free</i>, and overcomes the attraction which <i>impedes the
rise or fall of the mercury</i>.</p>

<p class="bq"><a href="#i-158b.jpg">Fig. 21</a> illustrates the mechanism at the back of the barometer. A
is a glass tube; between A and E there exists a <i>vacuum</i>, caused
by the weight of the mercury pressing downwards. This space
being a vacuum, makes the barometrical column more sensitive, as
there is no internal force to resist or modify the effects of
the external pressure. E represents the height of the column of
mercury; C the open end of the tube; F the weight resting on the
surface of the mercury; P the pivot over which the string passes,
and upon which the hand turns; W the weight which forms the pulley
with the weight F.</p>

<p><a id="question_697"></a>697. <i>Which is the heavier, dry or vaporised air?</i></p>

<p>Dry air is <i>heavier</i> than air impregnated with vapours.</p>

<p><a id="question_698"></a>698. <i>Why is dry air heavier than moist air?</i></p>

<p>Because of the <i>extreme tenuity of watery vapours</i>, the density of
which is <i>less than that of atmospheric air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_699"></a>699. <i>Why does the fall of the barometer denote the approach of rain?</i></p>

<p>Because it shows that as the air <i>cannot support the full weight
of the column of mercury</i>, the atmosphere must be thin with watery
vapours.</p>

<p class="bq">The fall of the mercury in the long arm of the tube would cause
the weight F to be pressed upwards. This would release the string
to which the weight W is attached; it would, therefore, fall, and
turn the hand down to Rain or Much Rain.</p>

<p><a id="question_700"></a>700. <i>Why does the rise of the barometer denote the approach of fine
weather?</i></p>

<p>Because the external air becoming dense, and free from highly elastic
vapours, presses with increased force upon the mercury upon which the
weight F floats; that weight, therefore, sinks in the short tube as
the mercury rises in the long one, and in sinking turns the hand to
Change, Fair, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_701"></a>701. <i>Why does the barometer enable us to calculate the height of
mountains?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the barometer is carried up a mountain, <i>there is a less
depth of atmosphere above to press upon the mercury</i>;
 it therefore
falls, and by comparing various observations, it has been found
practicable to <i>calculate the height of mountains by the fall of the
mercury in a barometer</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_702"></a>702. <i>To what extent of variation is the weight of the atmosphere

<p>It may vary as much as <i>a pound and a half to the square inch</i> at the
level of the sea.</p>

<p><a id="question_703"></a>703. <i>When does the barometer stand highest?</i></p>

prevail.</p>

<p><a id="question_704"></a>704. <i>Why does the barometer stand highest at these times?</i></p>

<p>Because the atmosphere is exceedingly <i>dry and dense</i>, and fully
balances the <i>weight of the column of mercury</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_705"></a>705. <i>When does the barometer stand lowest?</i></p>

<p>When <i>a thaw follows a long frost</i>;
 or when <i>south-west winds</i>
prevail.</p>

<p><a id="question_706"></a>706. <i>Why does the barometer stand lowest at those times?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>much moisture exists in the air</i>, by which it is rendered
less dense and heavy.</p>

<p><a id="question_707"></a>707. <i>What effect has heat upon the barometer?</i></p>

<p>It causes the mercury to fall, <i>by evaporating moisture into the air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_708"></a>708. <i>What effect has cold upon the barometer?</i></p>

<p>It causes the mercury to rise, by <i>checking evaporation</i>, and

<p><a id="question_709"></a>709. <i>What is the thermometer?</i></p>

<p>The thermometer is an instrument in which <i>mercury</i> is employed to
indicate <i>degrees of heat</i>. Its name is derived from two Greek words,
meaning <i>heat measurer</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_710"></a>710. <i>Why does mercury indicate degrees of heat?</i></p>

<p>Because it <i>expands</i> readily with <i>heat</i>, and <i>contracts</i> with
<i>cold</i>;
 and as it passes freely through small tubes, it is the most
convenient medium for indicating <i>changes of temperature</i>.</p>

 and
as their thermometers have been adopted by various countries and
authors, it is now difficult to dispense with either of them.</p>

<p class="bq">We have combined the two (<i>see</i> <a href="#i-162.jpg">fig. 22</a>.) The diagram will, we
have no doubt, prove exceedingly useful to scientific readers
and experimentalists. There is also another system of notation,
adopted by the French, called the <i>centigrade</i>, but it is not much
referred to in Great Britain. In the centigrade thermometer 0 zero
is the freezing point, and 100 the boiling point. Fahrenheit's
scale is generally preferred. Reaumur's is mostly used in Germany.
Of Fahrenheit's scale 32 is the freezing point, 55 is moderate
heat, 76 summer heat in Great Britain, 98 is blood heat, and 212
is the boiling point. Mr. Wedgwood has invented a thermometer for
testing <i>high temperatures</i>, each degree of which answers to l30
degrees of Fahrenheit. According to his scale cast iron melts at
2,786 deg.; fine gold at 2,016 deg.; fine silver 1,873 deg.; brass
melts at 1,869 deg.; red heat is visible by day at 980 deg.; lead
melts 612 deg.; bismuth melts 476 deg.; tin melts 412 deg.; and
there is a curious fact with regard to the three metals, lead,
bismuth, and tin, that if they are mixed in the proportions of 5,
8, and 3 parts respectively, the mixture (after previous fusion)
will melt at a heat below that of boiling water.</p>

<p><a id="question_712"></a>712. <i>What is the difference between the thermometer and the
barometer?</i></p>

<p>In the thermometer the column of mercury is much smaller than in the
barometer, and is sealed from the air; while in the barometer the
column of mercury is open at one end to atmospheric influence.</p>

<p><a id="question_713"></a>713. <i>Why does the mercury in the thermometer, being sealed up,
indicate the external temperature?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the heat passes through the glass, in which the mercury is
enclosed, and <i>expanding or contracting the metal within the bulb</i>,
causes the small column above it to <i>rise</i> or <i>fall</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_715"></a>715. <i>Why does it vary more in the winter than in the summer?</i></p>

<p>Because the temperature of our climate <i>differs more from the
temperature of the torrid zones in the winter</i> than it does in the
<i>summer</i>, and the <i>inequalities of temperature</i> cause frequent
changes in the degree of prevailing heat.</p>

<p><a id="question_716"></a>716. <i>What is sound?</i></p>

<p>Sound is an <i>impression produced upon the ear</i> by <i>vibrations</i> of
<i>the air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_717"></a>717. <i>What causes the air to vibrate and produce sounds?</i></p>

<p>The atoms of <i>elastic bodies</i> being caused to <i>vibrate</i> by the
application of some kind of force, <i>the vibrations of those atoms are
imparted to the air</i>, and sound is produced.</p>

<p><a id="question_718"></a>718. <i>How do we know that sounds are produced by the vibrations of
the air, induced by the vibrations of the atoms of bodies?</i></p>

<p>If we take a tuning fork, and hold it to the ear, we hear <i>no sound</i>.
If we move it rapidly through the air, or if we blow upon it, it
produces <i>no sound</i>;
 but if we <i>strike it</i>, <i>a sound immediately
occurs</i>;
 the vibration of the fork may be seen, and felt by the hand
that holds it; and <i>as those vibrations cease</i>, the sound <i>dies away</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_719"></a>719. <i>How do we know that without air there would be no sound?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Because if a tuning fork were to be struck in a <i>vacuum</i> (as under

<i>vibrations</i> of the fork could be <i>distinctly seen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_720"></a>720. <i>How are the vibrations of sonorous bodies imparted to the air?</i></p>

<p>When a bell is struck, the force of the blow gives an instant
agitation to all its particles. The air around the bell is driven
back by the impulse of the force, and thus a <i>vibration of
compression</i> is imparted to the air; but the air returns to the
bell, by its own natural elasticity, thus producing a <i>vibration of
expansion</i>&mdash;when it is again struck, and thus <i>successive vibrations</i>
of compression and expansion are <i>transmitted through the air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_721"></a>721. <i>How rapidly are these vibrations transmitted through the air?</i></p>

<p>They travel at a rate of rather more than <i>a quarter of a mile in a
second</i>, or <i>twelve miles and three-fourths in a minute</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_722"></a>722. <i>Do all sounds travel at the same rate?</i></p>

<p>All sounds, whether strong or weak, high or low, musical or
discordant, <i>travel with the same velocity</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_723"></a>723. <i>Why are bells and glasses stopped from ringing by touching them
with the finger?</i></p>

<p>Because the contact of the finger <i>stops the vibration</i> of the atoms
of the metal and glass, which therefore <i>cease to impart vibrations
to the air</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_724"></a>724. <i>Why does a cracked bell give discordant sounds?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>connection</i> between the atoms of the bell being
<i>broken,</i> their vibrations are not uniform: some of the atoms vibrate
<i>more intensely</i> than the others; the vibrations imparted to the air
are therefore <i>jarring</i> and <i>discordant</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_725"></a>725. <i>Why, when we see a gun fired at a distance, do we see the flash

<p>C or Do, 480 vibrations in a second; B or Si, 450 vibrations; A

vibrations, the <i>higher</i> the note, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_728"></a>728. <i>Why does the length of a wire or string determine the sound
that it produces?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>shorter the string</i> the <i>more rapid</i> are its vibrations
when struck.</p>

<p><a id="question_729"></a>729. <i>Why does the tension of a wire or string affect its vibrations?</i></p>

<p>Because when the string or wire is tight, a touch communicates
vibrations to <i>all its particles</i>;
 but when it is loose the
vibrations are <i>imperfectly communicated</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_730"></a>730. <i>Why are some notes low and solemn, and others high and quick?</i></p>

<p>Because the vibrations of musical strings vary from 32 vibrations in

<p><a id="question_731"></a>731. <i>Why can our voices be heard at a greater distance when we speak

<p><a id="question_733"></a>733. <i>Why can we hear sounds at a greater distance on water than on

<p>For various reasons: because the smooth surface of water is a good

interfere with the transmission of sound; and because there are no
elevated objects to impede the progress of the vibrations.</p>

<p><a id="question_734"></a>734. <i>Why do sea-shells give a murmuring noise when held to the ear?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_735"></a>735. <i>Why can people in the arctic regions converse when more than a

<p><a id="question_736"></a>736. <i>Why do savages lay their heads upon the earth to hear the

digging at considerable distances.</p>

<p><a id="question_737"></a>737. <i>Why can church clocks be heard striking much more clearly at

<p><a id="question_741"></a>741. <i>What are echoes?</i></p>

<p>Echoes are sounds <i>reflected</i> by the objects on which they strike.</p>

<p><a id="question_742"></a>742. <i>Why do some echoes occur immediately after a sound?</i></p>

<p>Because the reflecting surface is <i>very near</i>;
 therefore the sound
returns immediately.</p>

<p><a id="question_743"></a>743. <i>Why do some echoes occur a considerable time after a sound?</i></p>

<p>Because they are at a considerable distance, and the sound takes time

<p><a id="question_744"></a>744. <i>Why do some echoes change the tone and quality of sound?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_746"></a>746. <i>Are sounds reflected only by distant objects?</i></p>

<p>Sounds are doubtless reflected by <i>walls and ceilings</i> around us. But
we do not perceive the echoes, because they are so near that they
occur at the same moment with the sound. In lofty buildings, however,
there is frequently a <i>double sound</i>, making the utterance of a
speaker indistinct. This arises from the echo following very closely
upon the sound.</p>

<p><a id="question_747"></a>747. <i>Why, when we are walking under an arch-way or a tunnel, do our
voices appear louder?</i></p>

<p>Because the sounds of our voices are <i>immediately reflected</i>. And
as a <i>gas reflector increases the intensity of light</i>, so <i>a sound
reflector</i> will <i>increase the apparent strength of our voices</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">There are many places where remarkable echoes occur. On the
banks of the Rhine, at Lurley, if the weather be favourable, the
report of a rifle, or the sound of a trumpet, will be repeated at
different periods, and with various degrees of strength, from crag
to crag, on opposite sides of the river alternately. A similar
effect is heard in the neighbourhood of some of the Lochs in
Scotland. There is a place at Woodstock, in Gloucestershire, which
is said to echo a sound fifty times. Near Rosneath, a few miles
from Glasgow, there is a spot where, if a person plays a bar of
music upon a bugle, the notes will be repeated by an echo, but a
third lower; after a short pause, another echo is heard, again in
a lower tone; then follows another pause, and a third repetition
follows in a still lower key. The effect is very enchanting. The
whispering galleries of St. Paul's, of the cathedral church of
Gloucester, and of the Observatory of Paris, owe their curious
effects to those laws of the reflection of sound, by which echoes
are produced; but in these cases the effect is assisted by the
elliptical form of the edifice, each person being in the focus of
an ellipse.</p>

<p><a id="question_748"></a>748. <i>What is water?</i></p>

<p>Water is a fluid composed of <i>two</i> volumes of <i>hydrogen</i> to <i>one</i>
of <i>oxygen</i>, or <i>eight</i> parts by weight of <i>oxygen</i> to <i>one</i> of
<i>hydrogen</i>. It is nearly colourless and transparent.</p>

<p><a id="question_749"></a>749. <i>Why, if a saucer of water be exposed to the air, will it
gradually disappear?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Because water is highly expansive, and <i>rises in thin vapour</i>, when

<p class="center bq">"Behold there ariseth a little cloud from the

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_750"></a>750. <i>Why does steam issue from the spout of a kettle?</i></p>

<p>Because the heat of the fire passes into the water, and <i>drives</i> its
atoms apart, making those of them that rise quickly to the surface
<i>lighter than the air</i>, upon which they consequently rise.</p>

<p><a id="question_751"></a>751. <i>Why does water become solid when it freezes?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>latent heat of the water</i> passes away from between its
atoms into the air; the atoms, therefore, draw closer together.</p>

<p><a id="question_752"></a>752. <i>Why, if the atoms of water draw closer together when freezing,
does ice expand, and occupy greater space than water?</i></p>

<p>Because, <i>when the atoms of water are congealing</i>, they do not form a
<i>compact mass</i>, but arrange themselves <i>in groups of crystal points</i>,
which occupy greater space. Water <i>contracts</i> when freezing until it
sinks to 40 deg., and then it <i>expands</i> as ice is formed.</p>

<p class="bq">32 deg. is said to be the <i>freezing</i> point, but it should be called
the <i>frozen</i> point.</p>

<p><a id="question_753"></a>753. <i>Why does water boil?</i></p>

<p>Because heat, <i>entering into the lower portions</i> of the water,
<i>expands</i> it; the heated portions are then <i>specifically lighter</i>
than those that are cooler; the hot water therefore <i>rises upward,
and forces the cooler water down</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_754"></a>754. <i>What proportion of the earth's surface is covered with water?</i></p>

<p>There are about one hundred and forty seven millions of square miles

<i>land</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_755"></a>755. <i>What is the amount of water pressure?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_756"></a>756. <i>What element is the most abundant in nature?</i></p>

<p><i>Oxygen</i>, which forms so large a part of <i>water</i>. Of animal
substances, <i>oxygen</i> forms <i>three-fourths</i>;
 of <i>vegetable substances</i>
it forms <i>four-fifths</i>;
 of <i>mineral substances</i> it forms <i>one-half</i>;

it forms <i>eight-ninths</i> of the <i>waters</i> and <i>one-fifth</i> of the
<i>atmosphere</i>;
 and aggregating the whole creation, from <i>one-half to
two-thirds</i> consists of <i>oxygen</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_757"></a>757. <i>In what ways does man use oxygen?</i></p>

<p>Man <i>eats</i>, <i>drinks</i>, <i>breathes</i>, and <i>burns</i> it, in various
proportions and combinations. It is estimated that <i>the human race</i>
consume in those various ways 1,000,000,000 lbs. daily; that the
<i>lower animals</i> consume double that amount; and that, in the varied
works of nature, no less than 8,000,000,000 lbs. of <i>oxygen</i> are used
<i>daily</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_758"></a>758. <i>Why does water dissolve various substances?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>atoms of water</i> are very minute; they therefore
<i>permeate the pores</i>, or spaces, between the atoms of those bodies,
and <i>overcoming their attraction for each other</i>, cause them to
separate.</p>

<p><a id="question_759"></a>759. <i>Why does hot water dissolve substances more readily than cold?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>heat assists to repel the particles</i> of the substance
undergoing solution, and <i>gives the water a freer passage</i> between
the atoms.</p>

<p><a id="question_760"></a>760. <i>Why is pump water sometimes hard?</i></p>

<p>Because, in passing through the earth, it has become impregnated with
mineral matters, usually the <i>sulphate</i> and <i>carbonate of lime</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_761"></a>761. <i>Why is rain water soft?</i></p>

<p>Because it is derived from vapours which, in ascending to the clouds,
<i>could not bear up the mineral waters with them</i>. It therefore became
purified or distilled.</p>

<p><a id="question_762"></a>762. <i>Why do kettles become encrusted with stony deposits?</i></p>

<p>Because that portion of the water which is driven off in steam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
<i>leaves the mineral matters behind</i>;
 they therefore form a crust
around the sides of the kettle.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_763"></a>763. <i>Why is it difficult to wash in hard water?</i></p>

<p>Because the soap unites with the mineral matters in the water, and
being <i>neutralised</i> thereby, cannot <i>dissolve the dirt</i> which we
desire to cleanse away.</p>

<p><a id="question_764"></a>764. <i>Why is the sea salt?</i></p>

<p>Because salt is a mineral which prevails largely in the earth, and
which, <i>being very soluble in water</i>, is taken up by the ocean.</p>

<p>Lakes and rivers, also, even those that are considered fresh, hold in
solution <i>some degree of saline matters</i>, which they contribute to
the ocean.</p>

<p>As, in the evaporations from the sea, the salt remains in it, while
the vapours fall as rain, and again wash the earth and carry some of
its mineral properties to the ocean, the <i>greater saltness of the
sea</i>, as compared with rivers, is accounted for.</p>

<p>By some persons the opinion is entertained that the sea has been
<i>gradually getting salter</i> ever since the creation of the world.
This, they say, arises from the evaporation of water free from salt,
and the returns of the water to the sea, taking with it salt from the
land.</p>

<p><a id="question_765"></a>765. <i>What is the estimated amount of salt in the sea?</i></p>

<p>The amount of common salt in the various oceans is estimated at
3,051,342 <i>cubic geographical miles</i>, or about five times more than
the mass of the mountains of the Alps.</p>

<p><a id="question_766"></a>766. <i>What is the depth of the sea?</i></p>

<p>The extreme depth has not, probably, been ascertained. But Sir James
Ross took soundings about 900 miles west of St. Helena, whence he
found the sea to be nearly <i>six miles in depth</i>. Now, if we take the
height of the highest mountain to be five miles, the distance from
that extreme rise of the earth, to the known depth of the sea, will
be no less than <i>eleven miles</i>.</p>

matters?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the water passes through beds of soda, lime, magnesia,
carbonic acid, oxides of iron, sulphate of iron, &amp;c., &amp;c., and <i>takes
up in some slight degree the particles of those minerals</i>, according
to the proportions in which they abound.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_768"></a>768. <i>Why does iron rust rapidly when wetted?</i></p>

<p>Because the water contains a large proportion of oxygen, some of
which combines with the iron and forms <i>an oxide of iron</i>, which is
<i>rust</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_769"></a>769. <i>Why does stagnant water become putrid?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>large amount of oxygen</i> which it contains accelerates
the decomposition of dead <i>animal and vegetable substances</i> that
accumulate in it.</p>

<p><a id="question_770"></a>770. <i>Is there danger in drinking water on account of the living
animalcules which it contains?</i></p>

<p>No danger arises from the <i>living creatures</i> in water; but
<i>putrefactive</i> matters may produce serious diseases.</p>

<p><a id="question_771"></a>771. <i>What is the best method of guarding against impurities?</i></p>

<p>By obtaining water from the purest sources, and by filtering it

<p><a id="question_775"></a>775. <i>Why do bodies lighter than the air ascend?</i></p>

<p>Because the air, being a denser body, <i>obeys the law of attraction</i>,
and in doing so <i>displaces lighter bodies</i> that interfere with its

<p class="bq"><i>Affinity.</i>&mdash;Attraction between dissimilar particles through

<p><a id="question_781"></a>781. <i>Why do small bodies floating upon water move towards larger

<p>Because the attractive power of a <i>large body</i> is greater than that
of <i>a small one</i>. As each atom of matter has inherent power of
attraction, it follows that a <i>large aggregation of particles</i> must
attract in proportion to the number of those particles.</p>

<p>By observing what is called the <i>deflection</i> of small bodies <i>when
brought within given distances of larger bodies</i>, the degree of
attraction <i>exercised by the large body upon the smaller one</i> becomes
known. This attraction of the <i>large body</i> exercised over the
<i>smaller body</i> is an opposing influence, <i>acting against the earth's
attraction of the small body</i>, which is drawn out of its course: it
constitutes a <i>natural balance between the influence of the earth and
another body, acting in opposition to it</i>. Founded upon these, and
some other data, man can weigh the earth, and give a morally certain
result!</p>

<p><a id="question_793"></a>793. <i>Why does dew form into round drops upon the leaves of plants?</i></p>

<p>Carbonic acid is a mixture of <i>carbon</i> and <i>oxygen</i>, in the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>It exists in various natural bodies in which carbon and oxygen are
combined; it is evolved by the decomposition of numerous bodies
called carbonates, in which carbon is united with a particular base,
such as the carbonate of lime, the carbonate of iron, the carbonate
of copper, &amp;c. It is also evolved by the processes of <i>fermentation</i>,
by the <i>breathing of animals</i>, the <i>combustion of fuel</i>, and the
<i>functions of plants</i>. Carbonic acid also <i>exists in various waters</i>.</p>

<p>Carbonic acid is <i>found most largely in solid combinations with other
bodies</i>: it forms 44-100ths of all limestones and marbles, and it
exists in smaller quantity, combined with other earths, and with
metallic oxides.</p>

<p><a id="question_800"></a>800. <i>What are the states in which pure carbonic acid exists?</i></p>

<p>Pure carbonic acid may exist in the <i>solid</i>, the <i>liquid</i>, or
the <i>æriform</i> state. In the <i>solid state</i> it is produced only
by artificial means, and it is then a white crystallised body,
in appearance <i>like snow</i>;
 in the <i>liquid state</i> it is a <i>heavy
colourless fluid</i>;
 in the <i>æriform state</i> it is a <i>pungent</i>, <i>heavy</i>,
<i>colourless gas</i>, and is known as <i>carbonic acid gas</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_801"></a>801. <i>Why does bottled porter produce large volumes of froth, much
more than the bottle could contain?</i></p>

<p>Because, by the fermentive process, <i>carbonic acid</i> has been
developed in the porter, and is held in <i>liquid solution</i>;
 but it
always has a <i>strong tendency to escape</i>, and directly the pressure
is removed, it <i>evolves into gas</i>, by which it occupies much greater
space, and forces the porter in millions of small bubbles out of the
bottle.</p>

<p><a id="question_802"></a>802. <i>Why does soda-water effervesce?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_807"></a>807. <i>Why do the bubbles arise from two or three points in columns,
rapidly succeeding each other?</i></p>

<p>Because, when the formation of gas once begins, and bubbles ascend,
there is <i>less pressure</i> in the line of the <i>column of bubbles</i>;
 the
carbonic acid, therefore, draws towards those points as the <i>easiest
channel of escape</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">These explanations equally apply to the "working" of beer, by

<p>Gunpowder is made of a very intimate <i>mechanical mixture</i> of <i>nitrate

heated to a certain degree, the nitrate of potash is decomposed,
and its <i>oxygen</i> combines with the <i>charcoal</i> and <i>sulphur</i>,
instantaneously forming <i>large volumes of carbonic acid gas</i> and
<i>nitrogen</i>, which, seeking an escape, produce an explosion.</p>

<p class="bq">Let us now pause for a few moments to consider the importance of
those two great divisions of nature, Air and Water, and to reflect
upon the wisdom of some of those laws which are connected with
the phenomena thereof, and which have not yet been sufficiently
explained.</p>

<p class="bq">We have seen that the air is a thin elastic body surrounding the
globe; that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
 it consists of certain gases essential to the life of
animals, and to the growth of plants; and that it takes part in
most of those chemical changes, which mark the transformations
of the inorganic creation. Whether it be the burning of a piece
of wood, the evaporation of a drop of water, the breathing of an
animal, the respiration of a plant, or the fermentation of bodies,
the air in almost every instance gives or receives&mdash;and in most of
the operations in which it engages, it does both.</p>

<p class="bq">But there is one point of view, which we must add to those which
have already been considered: the order of nature consists of
generation, life, and death. Every beat of the watch signals the
birth of millions of living things, and the same beat proclaims
that as many living organisms have yielded up their vital spark,
and that forthwith the elements of which they are composed must be
dissolved, and restored to the great laboratory of nature.</p>

<p class="bq">The air is the vast receptacle of those organic matters which are
undergoing dissolution. The body of the shipwrecked mariner, cast
upon the shore of a desolate island, blackens in the sun, and the
full round form gradually dwindles to skin and bone, until at last
the few atoms that remain crumble into dust, and are scattered
to the wind. The same process occurs, with some modifications,
whether bodies are buried in the earth, or dissolve upon its
surface. The leaves of forests fall and accumulate in heaps,
where they ferment and dissolve, leaving only their more earthy
particles behind.</p>

<p class="bq">The amount of matter which day by day passes from the state
of the living to that of the dead, must be enormous; but from
the difficulties of acquiring data, beyond the possibility of
calculation. Such statistics as we have, however, enable us to
form conclusions as to the mighty agencies in which the air
is constantly engaged. There are on the earth 1,000,000,000
inhabitants of whom nearly 35,000,000 die every year, 91,824 every
day, 3,730 every hour, and 60 every minute. But <i>even the living
die daily</i>, and undergo an invisible change of substance, as we
shall hereafter explain.</p>

<p class="bq">The bodies of those many millions are dissolved in the air, in
vapours and gases which, before the dissolution of each corporeal
organism is complete, begin to live again in the various forms of
vegetable and animal life.</p>

<p class="bq">Of the number of animals living and dying upon the face of the
earth, we can form no adequate estimate. Of mammals there are
about 2,000 ascertained species; of birds 8,000 species; of
reptiles 2,000 species; of fishes some 8,000 or 10,000 species;
of molluscs some 15,000 species; of shell fish 8,000 species; of
insects 70,000 species. And, including others not specified here,
the total number of <i>species</i> of animals probably amounts to no
less than 250,000,&mdash;each species consisting of <i>many millions</i> of
living creatures.</p>

<p class="bq">In the area of London alone, no less than 200,000 tons of fuel
are annually cast into the air in the form of smoke. And if we
take into account the vast operations of nature in evaporation,
fermentation, and putrefactive decomposition, we may be enabled
to form a conception of the mighty part which that <i>thin air</i>, of
which we think so little, plays in the grand alchemy of nature.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and
wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth
right well."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm cxxxix.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">In addition, also, to the facts already communicated, respecting
the sound-bearing and light-refracting properties of air, it
must be remarked, that but for the atmosphere, and the general
refraction of light by its particles&mdash;each atom as it were
catching a fairy taper, and dancing with it before our view&mdash;the
condition of vision would be widely opposite to that which exists,
and totally <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
unsuited to our wants. The various objects upon
which the illuminating rays of the sun fell, would be lighted up
with an intense glare, but all around would be darkness, just as
when a single ray of light is passed into a dark chamber, and
directed upon a solitary object. The air, without becoming itself
visible, <i>diffuses luminous rays</i>, in modified intensity, in every
direction. If the air reflected so much light as to render <i>itself
visible</i>, it would appear like the glittering surface of the water
reflecting the solar rays, and we should then be unable to see the
various objects which surround us.</p>

<p class="bq">Of the importance of Water in the scheme of creation, man
generally entertains an imperfect conception. It is simply
supposed to afford moisture to plants, drink to animals, and to
promote salubrity by its cleansing properties. Let us, however,
contemplate man as he stands before us, noble in form, erect
in position, full of strength, joy, ambition. How much of that
noble form is composed of water? Suppose that it could all be
instantaneously withdrawn&mdash;not the oxygen and the hydrogen, which
might combine to form water&mdash;but the fluid that exists in his
body as <i>water</i>, unchanged&mdash;except by mechanical admixture with
the secretions of the body&mdash;Why then that beautiful temple would
collapse and become a mere shred, so thin, that it would seem but
a shadow of the body as it existed before, and the beholder might
doubt whether life ever inhabited a frame whose structure was so
frail. It is said that <i>three-fourths</i> by weight of the human body
consist of <i>water</i>. Thus, if man weighs 120lbs., 90lbs. consist of
water, and this subtracted, only 30lbs. of solid matter remain.
This statement is rather under than over the fact.</p>

<p class="bq">The assertion is startling, but so true that it can be verified
by simple experiment. A piece of lean flesh&mdash;say of beef&mdash;cut an
inch thick, and placed in a slow oven, and allowed to remain until
all its water was driven off in vapour, would become as thin as a
wafer, and as light as a cork. With a more scientific arrangement,
it would be possible to collect the water, and the weights of the
condensed vapour, and of the solid residue, would together make
up the weight of the beef: if the piece weighed sixteen ounces,
the weight of the water would be about 14 ounces, and the <i>solid
matter</i> about <i>two ounces</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">Water holds a similar proportion in the bodies of all animals,
and of vegetables. It is evident, therefore, that it occupies a
more important place in the scale of creation than is generally
accorded to it by the unobservant mind. We are indebted to it for
those atmospheric changes which constitute the peculiar feature
of our varying climate. Rising in invisible vapours, it builds
palaces of glory in the skies, and often presents to the view of
man the imagery of heaven. Persons who have ascended above the
altitude of the clouds, have described the scene upon looking down
towards them as the most celestial that the mind can conceive.
Fields of fleecy radiance, majestically rolling like a sea of
gold, occupied the whole range of vision, and seemed to embellish
an eternity of space. Those golden clouds that at one time are
decked in the richest splendour, and occupy the upper chambers
of the Court of Nature, become grave councillors when the earth
grows thirsty, and the plant droops with languor. They roll
their heavy brows together, as in consultation upon some grave
necessity: down come the refreshing showers, the mighty tongue
of thunder rocks the air, the earth is drenched, and becomes
fresh with the salubrity of her toilette; obnoxious substances,
with their offensive exhalations, are swept away: living things
rejoice, and beautiful flowers throw their incense in thanksgiving
into the air; the broad blue heavens for a time look down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
smile upon the blessed work; and then the clouds again gather
in a golden train, and one by one fill the high arches of the
atmosphere, until the earth once more grows thirsty, and the
flower supplicates for drink.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"How mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is
an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">With reference to Light, its wonders, and the curious but
imperfect theories respecting it, we have little to add, except
with regard to its physiological action upon the eyes of man
and of animals, which will be given in another place. But of
its sister, Darkness&mdash;for it would not do now to call darkness
the antagonist of light, since it will be seen that they work
harmoniously for good&mdash;we have to say, that recent discoveries
indicate that darkness is as necessary to the health of nature
as light. Not only is it necessary to compose man and animals
to sleep, to give rest to the over-wrought nerves of the
industrious&mdash;but light is the quickening power of vegetation,
and although plants grow by night, they grow, as man does, when
stretched upon his bed&mdash;but some of their functions, which
are actively excited in the presence of light, are at rest in
darkness. Nor is this all: there is not an atom upon the face
of the earth which is not affected by the rays of the sun,
their light, their heat, their actinism. Colours change: some
are bleached, others are darkened. All bodies are expanded. The
hardest rock sustains <i>an effect</i> from the sun's rays; and an
unceasing sun, shining upon the hardest granite, would in time
produce such a disturbance of its atomic condition, that adamant
would crumble away to dust.</p>

<p class="bq">The going down of the sun, therefore, marks the period when not
only does the bird fly to her resting-place, and man turn to his
couch; but when <i>every atom of a vast hemisphere</i> subsides into a
state of quietude, and when homogeneous particles of matter return
to their mutual rest.</p>

<p class="bq">In a few succeeding lessons, we intend to point out some of the
scientific truths that are <i>illustrated in the use of toys</i>. We
think we shall be able to show to our young readers, that even the
hours of play may be made the periods of delightful instruction;
and that there is <i>no</i>"reason why" the acquirement of knowledge
should not sweetly accord with the occasional pursuit of those
pastimes by which health of body and vigour of mind are induced.</p>

<p class="bq">But before we commence the discharge of that pleasant duty, let
us say a few words respecting Carbon, that important agent in the
world's history. It is, doubtless, perplexing to the minds of many
persons, to understand how the <i>diamond</i> can be <i>pure carbon</i>;
 how
<i>charcoal</i> can be <i>carbon</i> a <i>little less pure</i> than the diamond;
and how <i>coal</i> and <i>sugar</i> can also be carbon, <i>less pure</i> than
the charcoal. The statement that in the diamond carbon exists in
a different atomic condition, is almost as instructive to the
inquiring mind, as to say, "It is so, <i>because it is</i>."</p>

<p class="bq">Diamonds are expensive things, and so difficult to experiment
upon, even if they were not expensive, that the doors of inquiry
seem locked. To turn diamonds into charcoal, or into carbonic
acid gas, is a very costly formula of experiment. Charcoal fires,
thus sustained, would soon burn a man out of his house; and soda
water, impregnated with carbonic acid gas, produced from diamonds,
would be a very expensive beverage. If we could only turn charcoal
into diamonds, and carbonic acid gas into brilliants, that would
be quite another affair. A new Eldorado would be discovered,
and there would be so many experimenters that, when they all
succeeded, they would find that diamonds had lost their value.
However, as a fact for the encouragement of those who would like
to be early in the race, we may state that the atoms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> charcoal
which are repulsed from the charcoal points, during the electric
agitation which produces the electric light, acquire a hardness
and a sharpness almost equal to that of the diamond&mdash;only there
is still the awkward obstacle in the way, that <i>they happen to be
black</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs
and wonders in heaven and in earth."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daniel vii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">We must see, therefore, whether there is anything in nature that
we can experiment upon, theoretically or practically, to give us
a clearer conception of this difficult matter. There is a large
<i>dew-drop</i> resting upon a luxuriant cabbage leaf&mdash;one of those
great leaves that have flourished in defiance of the snail, and
now spreads out like the gigantic frond of the <i>Victoria Regina</i>.
That dew-drop is one of the beautiful diamonds which Nature
sprinkles about on cloudless nights, as if to show the stars,
in answer to their twinkling, that we have something that will
glisten and twinkle too.</p>

<p class="bq">The dew-drop is a very good imitation of a diamond, and to the
lover of God's works, quite as precious as the stone set in gold.
It does not consist of carbon&mdash;it probably may have a mite of
carbonic acid in its embrace&mdash;but that is not necessary to our
purpose: all we want to know is, <i>the different atomic conditions</i>
of which bodies are susceptible, and the very dissimilar
appearances they exhibit under the variations of atomic states. It
doesn't glisten so much as the diamond, <i>because it is round</i>&mdash;if
we could cut it into a number of <i>facets</i>, it would refract light
almost as perfectly as the diamond. It is not <i>solid</i>&mdash;but we
can freeze it, and we shall at once exhibit two different atomic
conditions, that will represent nearly enough the diamond, and
the liquid carbonic acid. Then, if we evaporate the dew-drop, we
shall produce a volume of vapour nearly <i>two thousand times as
large as the dew-drop</i>. The steam will be white; but we have only
to imagine it black, and then we get an analogy of the differences
of the atomic conditions that prevail in <i>the diamond</i>, <i>carbonic
acid</i>, and <i>charcoal</i>, <i>tinder</i>, <i>lamp-black</i>, or any light form
of carbon. Of course we have been illustrating <i>atomic conditions
only</i>, and not chemical composition.</p>

<p class="bq">There are a few other facts connected with carbon that merit
consideration. Carbonic acid gas, <i>entering the lungs</i>, is a
<i>deadly poison</i>;
 but <i>entering the stomach</i>, which lies close
under the lungs, and is over-lapped by them, it is a <i>refreshing
beverage</i>. Although charcoal, when burnt, gives off the most
poisonous gas, it seems to be very jealous of other gaseous
poisons; for if it be powdered, and set about in pans where there
is a poisonous atmosphere, it will seize hold of poisonous gases,
and, by absorbing, imprison them. Even in a drop of toast and
water, the charred bread seizes hold of whatever impurities exist
in the water; and water passed through beds of charcoal, becomes
filtered, and made beautifully pure, being compelled to give up
to the charcoal whatever is obnoxious. If a piece of meat that
has already commenced putrifying, be sprinkled with charcoal, it
will not only object to the meat putrifying any further, but it
will <i>sweeten that which has already undergone putrefaction</i>.
Although, in the form of gas, it will poison the blood, and cause
speedy stupefaction and death; if it be powdered, and stitched
into a piece of silk, and worn before the mouth as a respirator,
it will say to all poisonous gases that come to the mouth with the
air, "I have taken this post to defend the lungs, and I arrest
you, on a charge of murderous intention." Such are the various
facts connected with carbon; and they forcibly indicate that those
who understand Nature's works, are likely to receive her best
protection.</p>

<p><a id="question_814"></a>814. <i>Why does a top stand erect when it spins, but fall when it

<p>Because the top is under the influence of, and is balanced between
<i>opposing forces</i>. The rapid rotation of the top gives to all its
particles a tendency to <i>fly from the centre</i>. If the atoms of the
wood were not held together by the <i>attraction of cohesion</i>, they
would fly away in a circle outward from the top, <i>just as drops of
water fly off from a mop, while it is being twirled</i>. If you take a
spoonful of sand, salt, or dust, and drop it upon the top, it will
be scattered in a circle, just as the atoms of the top would be, <i>if
they were free to separate</i>, but not with the same force, because the
atoms of the salt, &amp;c., not being in an active state of rotation,
would only be influenced <i>by momentary contact with the rotating
body</i>. This tendency of the particles of a rotating body to fly
outward from the centre, is called <i>the centrifugal force</i>.</p>

<p class="bq"><i>Centrifugal.</i>&mdash;From two Latin words meaning receding from the
centre.</p>

<p>The other force influencing the top is <i>the attraction of
gravitation</i>: the attraction which, were the top not spinning, would
draw it towards the earth. The "spill" projecting from the bottom of
the top <i>stands in the line in which the top is drawn towards the
earth</i> and keeps it from obeying the law of gravitation. Therefore
the rotatory motion given to the top, by the rapid unwinding of the
string, and the tendency of its atoms to fly outward, <i>balance the
top</i> upon the line in which it is drawn to the earth, and which is
occupied by the spill, which prevents it falling to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="question_815"></a>815. <i>Why does a top first reel around upon the spill, then become
upright, and "sleep," and then reel again, and fall?</i></p>

<p>Because, in being thrown from the hand, the top is delivered a
little out of the perpendicular, but the spill <i>is rounded off at
the point</i>, and when the top is rotating rapidly, the gravitative
force which attracts the top to the ground continually acting upon
it, <i>draws the weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> of the top on to the extreme centre of the
round point</i>. When the rotation subsides, and the centrifugal force
is weakened, then the top <i>is no longer balanced upon the extreme
point of the spill</i>, but falls upon its sides, until the force of
gravitation is exerted <i>beyond the line of the spill</i>, upon the body
of the top, and then it falls to the ground.</p>

<p><a id="question_816"></a>816. <i>Why does a top "sleep?"</i></p>

<p>Because at that period of its spinning, which is called "sleeping,"
the <i>centrifugal</i> and the <i>gravitative forces</i> acting upon the top,
are <i>nearly balanced</i>;
 and the top, obeying chiefly the <i>rotatory
force</i>, appears to be in a state of comparative rest.</p>

<p><a id="question_817"></a>817. <i>Why does the top cease to spin?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>the friction of the air against its sides</i>, and the
<i>friction of the spill against the ground</i>, act in opposition to
the <i>rotatory force</i>, which is a temporary impulse applied by
external means&mdash;the hand of the person who spins it&mdash;and as soon
as this <i>applied force</i> is expended, the top yields to the law of
gravitation, which is <i>a permanent and ever-prevailing force</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_818"></a>818. <i>Why does a marble revolve, as it is propelled along the ground?</i></p>

<p>Because, in propelling the marble, <i>the thumb impels the upper
surface forward, and the finger draws the under surface backward</i>.
This gives a tendency to the upper and lower hemispheres of the
marble <i>to separate</i>, which they would do, but for the <i>cohesion of
the atoms</i> of the marble. The upper part of the marble, therefore,
rolls forward, <i>drawing after it the under part</i>, which acquires a
forward motion by the force with which it is drawn upward, and in
this way the opposite portions of the marble act upon each other in
the successive revolutions.</p>

<p>When the marble strikes upon the earth, a new influence is exerted
upon it, which is <i>the friction of the earth</i> upon the surface that
comes in contact with it; but the upper part of the marble, being
free, <i>overcomes the friction acting upon the lower part</i>, and thus
the marble continues to progress, until <i>the applied force which
projected it is expended</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_854"></a>854. <i>Why does the pressure applied to the handle of an air pistol
propel the cork?</i></p>

<p>Because, between the cork A and the air-tight piston C, there is a
<i>closed chamber of air</i> b. When the handle D, which moves the piston
C, is rapidly pushed in, it <i>compresses the air</i> until it is so much
condensed, that it forces out the cork A.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
but as the air does not enter freely the water cannot escape. It

<p>Because the <i>centrifugal force</i> gives it a motion which is called the

off in a straight line</i>. When a piece of clay adhering to the hoop

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> the surface from which it was propelled; this line is <i>the

<p class="bq">We have said enough, we hope, to show that even the play-hours of

alone. Grown-up people, whether participators in the sports of
youth, or simple observers of their games, may gain instruction

taking an interest in their enjoyments, and giving to their minds,

<p class="bq">In Kay's "Life of Sir John Malcolm," we find an admirable and apt
passage. Sir John says:&mdash;"I have been employed these last few
hours with John Elliot, and other boys, in trying how long we
could keep up two cricket-balls. Lord Minto caught us. He says
he must send me on a commission to some very young monarch, for
that I shall never have the gravity of an ambassador for a prince
turned of twelve. He, however, added the well-known and admirable
story of Henry IV. of France, who, when caught on all fours
carrying one of his children, by the Spanish envoy, looked up and
said, 'Is your excellency married?' 'I am, and have a family,' was
the reply. 'Well, then,' said the monarch, 'I am satisfied, and
shall take another turn round the room,' and off he galloped, with
his son on his back flogging and spurring him. I have sometimes
thought of breaking myself of what are termed boyish habits; but
reflection has satisfied me that it would be very foolish, and
that I should esteem it a blessing that I can find amusement in
everything, from tossing a cricket-ball, to negotiating a treaty
with the Emperor of China. Men who will give themselves entirely
to business, and despise (which is the term) trifles, are very
able, in their general conception of the great outlines of a plan,
but they feel a want of knowledge, which is only to be gained by
mixing with all classes in the world, when they come to those
lesser points upon which its successful execution may depend."</p>

<p><a id="question_869a"></a>869. <i>Why do we eat food?</i></p>

<p>Because the atoms of which our bodies are composed are <i>continually
changing</i>. Those atoms that have fulfilled the purposes of nature
are removed from the system, and, therefore, new matter must be
introduced to supply their place.</p>

<p><a id="question_870"></a>870. <i>Why do we eat animal and vegetable food?</i></p>

<p>Because their substances are composed of <i>oxygen</i>, <i>hydrogen</i>,
<i>carbon</i>, and <i>nitrogen</i>&mdash;the four chemical elements of which the
human system is formed. They are, therefore, capable of nourishing
the body, after undergoing digestion.</p>

<p><a id="question_871"></a>871. <i>Why do we masticate our food?</i></p>

<p>Because mastication is <i>the first process towards the digestion of
food</i>. Before animal or vegetable substances can nourish us, their
condition must be entirely changed, their <i>organic</i> states must be
dissolved, and they must become simple matter, in a homogeneous mass,
consisting of the four chemical elements necessary to nutrition, and
they must again be restored to an organic condition.</p>

<p><a id="question_872"></a>872. <i>Why does saliva enter the mouth when we are eating?</i></p>

<p>Because, in addition to the <i>mechanical</i> grinding of the food by the
action of the teeth, it is necessary that it should undergo certain
chemical modifications to adapt it to our use. There are placed,
therefore, in various parts of the body, <i>glands</i>, which secrete
peculiar fluids, that have a chemical influence upon the food.</p>

<p>The first of these glands are the <i>salivary glands of the mouth</i>,
which pour out a clear watery fluid upon the food we eat, and which
fluid has been found to possess a property which contributes to the
digestion of food.</p>

<p>The moisture afforded by the salivary secretion is also necessary to
enable us to swallow the food.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's
mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or the seeing, or the blind? have not
I the Lord?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exodus iv.</span></p>

<p><a id="question_873"></a>873. <i>Why does the salivary juice enter the mouth just at the moment
that we are eating?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the glands, which are buried in the muscles of the mouth, and
which in their form are much like bunches of currants, are always
full of salivary secretion. There are nerves which are distributed
from the brain to these glands, and when other nerves which belong
to the senses of taste, of sight, or of feeling, are excited by the
presence of food, <i>a stimulus</i> is imparted to the salivary glands,
through the nerves that surround them, their cells collapse, and the
juice which they contain is poured out through their stems, or ducts,
into the mouth.</p>

<p><a id="question_874"></a>874. <i>How do we know that impressions imparted to one set of nerves,
may be imparted to another set, so as to put any particular organ in
action.</i></p>

<p>Because very frequently <i>the mere sight</i> of rich fruit, or acid
substances, <i>will cause the saliva to flow freely</i>. In this case it
is evident that the salivary glands <i>could not see or know</i> that such
substances were present. An impression must, therefore, be made upon
the brain, <i>through the organ of vision</i>, and the desire to taste the
substances being awakened, a nervous stimulus is <i>imparted to the
glands of the mouth</i>, and they at once commence their action, <i>as if
food were present</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_875"></a>875. <i>Why does food descend into the stomach?</i></p>

<p>Because, after the teeth, the tongue, and the muscles of the mouth
generally, have rolled the food into a soft bolus, it is conveyed
to the back of the mouth, where it is set upon the opening of the
throat (<i>&oelig;sophagus</i>). It does not then descend through the throat by
its own gravity, because the throat is generally in a compressed or
collapsed state, like an empty tube; and we know that persons can eat
or drink when with their heads downwards. The &oelig;sophagus is formed
of a number of muscular threads, or rings, and <i>each little thread
is like a hand ready to grasp at the morsel that is coming</i>. As soon
as the bolus is presented at the top of the throat, these little
muscular hands lay hold of it, and transmit it downward, passing it
from one to another, until it is conveyed through the long passage,
to the door of the stomach, which it enters.</p>

<i>pancreatic</i> juices enter and mingle with our food.</p>

<p><a id="question_876"></a>876. <i>Why do we not feel the food being transmitted through the
throat?</i></p>

<p>Because the nerves of the body differ in their powers: some are
nerves of <i>feeling</i>, some of <i>motion</i>, and others are nerves of the
<i>senses</i>. The nerves of feeling are most abundantly distributed to
those parts <i>where feeling is most useful and necessary to us</i>.
But the faculty of feeling our food undergoing digestion would be
no service to us whatever; therefore the nerves of <i>motion</i> are
plentifully distributed to the throat and stomach, but very few of
the nerves of <i>feeling</i>&mdash;just as many as will tell us when we eat
anything <i>too hot</i>, or <i>too cold</i>, or that the stomach is <i>out of
order</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_877"></a>877. <i>Why do we feel uneasy after eating to excess?</i></p>

<p>Because the stomach is <i>distended</i>, and presses upon the other organs

<p><a id="question_878"></a>878. <i>Why do we feel drowsy after eating heartily?</i></p>

<p>Because, while the stomach is in action, <i>a great proportion of the
blood of the body is drawn towards it</i>, and as the blood is withdrawn
from the other parts of the body, they fall into a state of languor.</p>

<p><a id="question_879"></a>879. <i>Why does blood flow more freely to the stomach during
digestion?</i></p>

<p>Because the energy of an organ is <i>increased by the flow of blood</i>,
which supplies the <i>material</i> of which our organs are composed, and
in which the <i>vital essence</i>, supporting life, resides.</p>

<p><a id="question_880"></a>880. <i>Why does excess in eating bring on indigestion?</i></p>

<p>Because the power of the stomach to digest food is <i>governed by the
amount of food required by the system</i>. It seems to be an instinct of
the stomach to hold back food which is in excess, and by indications
of pain and disturbance to warn its master that <i>excess has been
committed</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_881"></a>881. <i>Why is food digested in the stomach?</i></p>

<p>Because it enters the stomach in the form of a paste, produced by the
action of the mouth; and directly food enters, the <i>gastric juice</i>,
which is formed by glands embedded in the coats of the stomach,
trickles down its sides. This is a more <i>powerful solvent</i> than
the salivary juice&mdash;it is like the same kind of fluid, only much
stronger, and it soon turns the food from a rough and crude <i>paste</i>
into a <i>greyish cream</i> (chyme). The heat of the stomach assists the
operation, and the muscular threads of the coats move the cream
along, in the same manner that the muscles of the &oelig;sophagus brought
down the food.</p>

<p>The cream is passed towards the door which leads outward from the
stomach (<i>pylorus</i>); but if, in the midst of the cream, there are any
undissolved particles of food, it closes upon them, and they return
again to the stomach to be further changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the <i>liver</i> secretes a fluid to assist in the digestion
of food. The liver is a gland&mdash;a similar organ to the glands of
the mouth&mdash;and it forms <i>bile</i> in the same manner that they form
the salivary juice. Only the liver is a <i>much larger gland</i>, and a
much greater quantity of blood passes through it. The liver pours
its secretion into the biliary duct (<a href="#i-209.jpg">Fig. 49</a>) to mix with the grey
cream as it passes onward, and to further dissolve it. But when the
stomach is excited by food which it cannot dissolve, and when the
owner of the stomach, disregarding its remonstrances, will persist in
over-eating, or in eating things that disagree with the system, then
<i>the liver and the stomach sympathise</i>, and the muscular threads,
or hands, that prevail all through the alimentary organs, instead
of moving <i>onward</i>, move backward, and <i>throw some bile into the
stomach</i> to assist to dissolve and remove the excessive or improper
food.</p>

<p><a id="question_883"></a>883. <i>Why does some portion of the food we eat nourish the system,
while other portions are useless?</i></p>

<p>Because most food contains some particles that are indigestible,
or that, if digested, are innutritious, and not necessary for the
system. The <i>liver</i> is the organ by whose secretion the <i>useful

 for when the bile enters through
the duct (<a href="#i-209.jpg">Fig. 49</a>) and mixes with the grey cream coming from the
stomach, it remains no longer a grey cream, but turns into a mass
coloured by bile, having upon its surface <i>little globules of milk</i>,
small, but very white. Those minute globules of milk (<i>chyle</i>) are
the nutritious particles derived from the food; the other portion,
coloured with bile, is the useless residue, or rather the <i>bulk from
which the nutrition has been extracted</i>.</p>

conveys this nutrition (called chyle) upward along the back, until
it reaches where the duct turns into the junction of two veins, and
pours its contents into the veins bringing blood back to the heart.
The nutrition, therefore, is at this moment mixed with the venous
blood, and is sent to the lungs to be oxygenised.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_885"></a>885. <i>How is the nutrition taken away from the bilious residue?</i></p>

<p>The muscular threads (or hands, as we figuratively call them)
continue to push forward the digested matter through a long tube,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
called <i>the alimentary canal</i>, or bowels. This canal is some thirty
feet in length, and is folded in various layers across the abdomen,
and tied to the edge of a sort of apron, which is gathered up and
fastened to the back-bone. All along this alimentary canal those
muscular hands are pushing the digested mass along. But upon the coat
or surface of the canal there are millions of little vessels called
<i>lacteals</i>, which look out for the minute globules of milk as they
pass, and <i>absorb</i> them, which means that they pick them up, and
carry them away. There is an immense number of these little vessels,
all busily at work picking up food for the system.</p>

<p>Then there is a large vessel, called the <i>thoracic duct</i>, which comes
down and communicates with those little vessels (it is a sort of
overseer, having a large number of workmen,) and collects the produce
of their toil, and carries it upwards to the part where it passes
<i>from the organs of digestion</i> into the <i>vessels of circulation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_886"></a>886. <i>What becomes of the nutrition, when it has entered the vessels
of the circulation?</i></p>

<p>It is sent through a large vein into <i>the heart</i>, entering that organ
on the right side, from which the heart propels it into the lungs,
mixed with <i>venous blood</i>;
 and the venous, or blue blood, is sent
into the lungs, <i>taking with it the milk</i>, the formation of which we
have traced.</p>

<p><a id="question_887"></a>887. <i>Why are the venous blood and the chyle sent to the lungs?</i></p>

<p>Because the venous blood, in its circulation through the body, has
parted with its <i>oxygen</i>, and taken up <i>carbon</i>, and it requires <i>to
get rid of the carbon, and take up more oxygen</i>. The chyle, also,
now combined with the blood, requires <i>oxygen</i>, and having obtained
it, is converted into <i>bright red blood</i>, and the blue blood of
the veins, having got rid of its carbon, which formed the carbonic
acid of the breath, has again become <i>bright red blood</i>. We must
therefore, in pursuing our description, cease to speak of blue, or
<i>venous blood</i>, and of white milk, or <i>chyle</i>, for the two have now
combined, and, with the oxygen of the air, have formed <i>arterial
blood</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> flowing into

<p><a id="question_890"></a>890. <i>How does the blood communicate with the air in the lungs?</i></p>

<p>Through the <i>sides of very minute vessels</i>, of which, perhaps, a
<i>fine hair</i> gives us the best conception. But these vessels are
<i>twisted and wound round each other</i> in such a curious manner, that
they form <i>millions of cells</i>, and by being twisted and wound, a
much <i>greater surface of air and blood</i> are brought to act upon each
other, than could otherwise be accomplished.</p>

<p><a id="question_891"></a>891. <i>Why does the blood which is thus formed, impart vitality to the
parts to which it is sent?</i></p>

<p>Because the blood is itself <i>vitalised</i>&mdash;is, in fact, <i>alive</i>, and
capable of diffusing life and vitality to the organisation of which
it forms a part.</p>

<p>This is a very wonderful fact, but no less true than wonderful, that
dead matter which, but a little while ago, was being ground by the
teeth, softened by the saliva, and solved by the gastric juice and
bile, has now acquired <i>life</i>. Nobody can tell the precise stage or
moment when it began to live. But somewhere between the stomach and
the lungs, melted by the gastric juice, softened by the secretion of
the pancreas, separated by the bile of the liver, macerated by the
muscular fibres of the bowels, taken up by the absorbents, warmed by
the heat of the body, and ærated in the lungs, it has by one, or by
all of these processes combined, been changed from the dead to the
living state, and now forms part of the <i>vital fluid of the system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_892"></a>892. <i>Why do we know that the blood has become endowed with vital
powers?</i></p>

<p>Because, in the course of its formation, it has not only undergone
change of condition and colour; but, if examined now by the
microscope, it will be found to consist of millions of minute cells,
or discs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> which float in a watery fluid. The paste produced by
mastication consisted of a crude admixture of the atoms of food; the
cream (<i>chyme</i>) formed from this in the stomach, presents to the
microscope a heterogeneous mass of matter, exhibiting no appearance
whatever of a new organic arrangement; the milk (<i>chyle</i>) which is
formed in the intestines is found to contain a great number of very
small molecules, which probably consist of some fatty matter; as the
chyle progresses towards the <i>thoracic duct</i> (<a href="#i-212.jpg">Fig. 50</a>), it appears to
contain more of these, and slight indications present themselves of
the approach towards a new organic condition.</p>

<p>But wherever <i>vitalisation begins</i>, no human power can say with
confidence. Yet there can be no doubt that the blood is both
<i>organised</i> and <i>vitalised</i>, and that it consists of corpuscles, or
little cells, enclosing matters essential to life.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_893"></a>893. <i>Why does the blood circulate?</i></p>

<p>Because all the bones, muscles, blood-vessels, nerves, glands,
cartilages, &amp;c., of which the body is composed, are constantly
undergoing a <i>change of substance</i>. It is a condition of their life,
health, and strength, that they shall be "<i>renewed</i>," and the blood
is the great source of the <i>materials</i> by which the living temple is
kept in repair.</p>

<p><a id="question_894"></a>894. <i>How is the body renewed by the blood?</i></p>

<p>Every drop of blood is made up of a large number of corpuscles, each
of which contains some of the elements essential to the wants of the
system.</p>

<p>Let us, to simplify the subject, consider the blood vessels of the
body to be so many <i>canals</i>, on the banks of which a number of
inhabitants live, and require constant sustenance. The corpuscles
of the blood are the <i>boats</i> which are laden with that sustenance,
and when the heart beats, it is a signal for them to start on their
journey. Away they go through the arch of the great <i>aorta</i>, and some
of the earliest branches which it sends off convey blood to the arms.
We will now for a moment dismiss the word <i>artery</i>, and keep up the
figure of a system of canals, with a number of towns upon their banks.</p>

<p>Well, away go a fleet of boats through the <i>aorta</i> canal, until they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> boats
pass into the <i>axillary</i> canal and Shoulder-town is supplied; the
other boats proceed along the <i>humeral</i> canal until they approach
Elbow-town, when another division of the boats pass into other branch
canals and supply the wants of the neighbourhood; the others have
passed into the <i>ulnar</i> canals and the <i>radial</i> canals until they
have approached Wrist-town and Hand-town, which are respectively
supplied; and then the two canals have formed a junction across the
palm and supplied Palm-town, where they have given off branches and
boats to supply the four Finger-towns, and Thumb-town.</p>

<p><a id="question_895"></a>895. <i>How does the blood return to the lungs, after it has reached
the extremities?</i></p>

<p>The <i>veins</i> constitute a system of vessels corresponding to the
arteries. We may say that the arteries form <i>the down canal</i>, and the
veins <i>the up canal</i>. The arteries, commencing in the great trunk of
the <i>aorta</i>, branch off into large and then into smaller tubes, until
they form <i>capillary</i> or hair-like vessels, penetrating everywhere.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><i>The capillary extremities of the arteries, unite with the capillary
extremities of the veins,</i> and the blood passes from the one set of
vessels into the other. As the <i>arteries become smaller</i> from the
point where they receive the blood, so the <i>veins grow larger</i>;
 the
venous capillaries, pour their contents into small vessels, and these
again into larger ones, until the great <i>venous</i> trunks are reached,
and the blood is passed again into the heart as at first described.

<p><a id="question_896"></a>896. <i>Why do we see blue marks upon our arms and hands?</i></p>

<p>Because large veins lie underneath the skin, through which the blood
of the fingers and hand is <i>conveyed back to the heart</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_897"></a>897. <i>Why are the veins more perceptible than the arteries?</i></p>

<p>Because the arteries are buried <i>deeper in the flesh, for
protection</i>. It would be <i>more dangerous to life to sever by accident
an artery than a vein</i>. A person might bleed longer from a vein than
from an artery, without endangering life; because the arteries supply
the <i>life sustaining blood</i>. The Almighty, therefore, has buried the
arteries for safety.</p>

<p><a id="question_898"></a>898. <i>Why when we prick the flesh with a needle does it bleed?</i></p>

<p>Because the capillary arteries and veins are so fine, and are so
thickly distributed all over the body, that not even the point of a
needle can enter the flesh without penetrating the coats of several
of these small vessels.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_899"></a>899. <i>What occurs during the circulation of the blood?</i></p>

<p>Not only do the various parts to which the boats are sent take from
them whatever they require, but <i>the boats collect all those matters
for which those parts have no further use</i>. The bones, the nerves,
the muscles, &amp;c., all renew themselves as the boats pass along; and
all give something to the boats to bring back. One of the chief
exchanges is that of <i>oxygen</i> for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<i>carbon</i>, by which a gentle <i>heat</i>
is diffused throughout the system. It is for this purpose that <i>fresh
air</i> is so <i>constantly necessary</i>.</p>

<p>But other exchanges take place. The blood, in addition to oxygen and
carbon, contains <i>hydrogen</i> and <i>nitrogen</i>. But it contains its four
elements in <i>various forms of combination</i>, producing the following
<i>materials</i> for the use of the body: of 1,000 parts of blood, <i>about</i>
779 are <i>water</i>;
 141 are <i>red globules</i>;
 69 are <i>albumen</i>;
 3 are
<i>fibrin</i>;
 2 are <i>fatty matter</i>;
 6 are various <i>salts</i>.</p>

<p>Albumen and fibrin are a kind of flesh imperfectly formed, and
probably are chiefly used in repairing the muscles. The red
corpuscles contain the oxygen which goes to combine with the
superabundant carbon, and develop heat; the fatty matters probably
repair the fatty tissues, and glands that are of a fatty nature;
and the various salts contribute to the bones, and to the chemical
properties of those secretions which are formed by the glands,
&amp;c., while the great proportion of water is employed in cleansing,
softening, and cooling the whole, or the living edifice, and it is
the medium through which all the nutrition of the body is distributed.</p>

<p><a id="question_900"></a>900. <i>Why do we feel the pulse beat?</i></p>

<p>Because every time that the heart contracts it send a fresh supply of
blood to the blood-vessels, and the motion thus imparted creates <i>a
general pulsation throughout the system</i>: but it is more distinctly
perceived at the pulse, because there a rather <i>large artery lies
near to the surface</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_901"></a>901. <i>What becomes of the matter collected by the blood in the course
of its circulation?</i></p>

<p>We have already explained that carbon is thrown off from the lungs in
the form of carbonic acid gas. But there are many other matters to
be separated from the venous blood, and its purification is assisted
by the action of the liver, which is supplied with a large vein,
called the <i>portal vein</i>, which conveys into the substance of the
liver, a large proportion of the venous blood, from which that organ
draws off those matters which form the bile, and other matters which
are transmitted with the bile to the bowels. The <i>liver</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> the
<i>lungs</i>, therefore, are the great purifiers of the venous blood. But
there are also smaller organs that assist in the same work.</p>

<p>If the cut is so deep and serious as to destroy the <i>system of

they cannot work so perfectly as when in their sound condition. Their

sometimes <i>separates in small patches from the membrane</i> below, and
becomes <i>dry and opaque</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_910"></a>910. <i>Why is there a circular line of whitish colour at the root of
the nail?</i></p>

<p>Because there the nail is <i>newly formed</i> by the vascular substance
out of which it grows, and has not yet assumed its proper horny and
transparent nature.</p>

<p><a id="question_911"></a>911. <i>Why is the eyeball white?</i></p>

<p>Because the blood-vessels that supply its surface are so very fine
that they do not admit the <i>red corpuscles</i> of the blood.</p>

<p><a id="question_912"></a>912. <i>Why does the eyeball sometimes become blood-shot?</i></p>

<p>Because, under exciting causes of inflammation, the <i>blood-vessels
become distended</i>, and the red corpuscles enter, producing a net-work
of red blood-vessels across the white surface of the eye.</p>

<p><a id="question_913"></a>913. <i>Why are the lips red?</i></p>

<p>Because the lips are formed of the <i>mucous membrane</i> that lines the
body internally, and covers the surface of most of the internal
parts. This membrane contains a great number of minute red vessels,
which give softness and moisture to the surface. A very beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
illustration of the softness, moisture, and delicate colour of the
mucous membrane is afforded by turning up and examining the under
surface of the upper eyelid.</p>

<p><a id="question_914"></a>914. <i>Why do delicate persons look pale and languid?</i></p>

<p>Because, generally from the want of exercise and fresh air, their
blood is deficient of the healthy proportion of <i>red corpuscles</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_915"></a>915. <i>Why does exercise and fresh air impart to healthy persons a red
and fresh appearance?</i></p>

<p>Because the redness of the blood is due to the <i>amount of oxygen</i>
which it contains, and air and exercise <i>oxygenise</i> the blood, and
diffuse it throughout the system.</p>

<p><a id="question_916"></a>916. <i>How is the blood propelled through the arteries?</i></p>

<p>By the very powerful contraction (and alternate dilation) of the
thick <i>muscles of the heart</i>, assisted also by the <i>muscular cords
of the blood-vessels</i> themselves, and in many instances by the
<i>compression of the muscles</i> in which the arteries lie embedded.</p>

<p><a id="question_917"></a>917. <i>Why are the capillary arteries capable of receiving the great
quantity of blood sent out through the larger vessels?</i></p>

<p>Because the capillary vessels are <i>so numerous</i>, that though they are
infinitely smaller, they are capable of receiving in their minute
tubes <i>the whole of the quantity of blood</i> transmitted to them
through the larger vessels.</p>

<p><a id="question_918"></a>918. <i>Why, when we sit with our legs crossed, do we see the foot that
is raised move at regular intervals?</i></p>

<p>Because the pressure upon the muscles of the leg retards the progress
of the blood until it forces <i>itself through the compressed vessels</i>,
and thereby imparts a pulsation which moves the leg and foot.</p>

<p><a id="question_919"></a>919. <i>Why are capillary blood-vessels found in every part of the
system?</i></p>

<p>Because it is <i>through these small vessels alone</i> that the substances
of the body are renewed and changed. Even the larger blood-vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
<i>do not sustain themselves upon the blood which they contain</i>, but
receive into their coats numerous capillary vessels by which they are
nourished.</p>

(<i>See</i> <a href="#question_623">623</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="question_921"></a>921. <i>How does the blood ascend in the veins, in opposition to
gravitation?</i></p>

<p>In addition to the muscular coats of the veins, and the influence
of muscular action upon them, there are in the veins numerous
semi-circular valves, which are not found in the arteries. These
valves extend from the sides of the veins in such a manner that they
allow the free passage of the blood upwards, but a backward motion of
the blood would expand the cup-like valves and stop the passage; so
that the blood can only move in one direction, and that <i>towards the
heart</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_922"></a>922. <i>How frequently does the total amount of blood circulate through
the system?</i></p>

<p>The blood circulates once through the body in about <i>two minutes</i>.
If, therefore, we estimate the amount of blood at twenty-four pounds,
it follows that no less than <i>twelve pounds of blood pass through the
heart every minute</i>;
 and it is estimated that if the blood moved with
equal force in a straight line it would pass through <i>one hundred and
fifty feet in a minute</i>.</p>

<p>They <i>protect</i> soft and delicate organs; they form a framework to

receives from them a similar protection <i>to that which the brain
obtains from the skull</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_928"></a>928. <i>Why is the head set upon the neck?</i></p>

<p>Because in that position it obtains the <i>freest motion</i>, can turn

<p><a id="question_929"></a>929. <i>Why are the eyes placed in the sockets of the skull?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_932"></a>932. <i>Why are the heart, lungs, &amp;c., placed within the chest?</i></p>

<p>Because the functions of those organs require <i>considerable space</i>,
while their importance in the system of life, renders it essential
that they should be <i>securely protected</i> from the probabilities of
accident.</p>

<p><a id="question_933"></a>933. <i>Why are the heart and lungs enclosed for protection in a series
of ribs, and not in a close case, like the brain?</i></p>

<p>Because, by the inflation and contraction of the lungs, their
<i>capacity is constantly changing</i>. When man takes a moderate
inspiration, he inhales about <i>thirty cubic inches of air</i>, and the
lungs increase in size <i>one-eighteenth of their whole capacity</i>.
Consequently, were they enclosed in a frame of <i>fixed dimensions</i>,
it must needs be, to that extent at least, larger than is necessary,
when the frame is made to dilate and contract with the capacity of
the lungs.</p>

<p>So perfect is the Almighty contrivance, that not only are the ribs
made to <i>protect</i> the lungs, but, by their elasticity, and the
contractions and dilations of the muscles which lie between them,
they <i>assist the lungs in their labours</i>, and work with them in
perfect harmony.</p>

<p><a id="question_936"></a>936. <i>Why are the bones of the hands and feet numerous and small?</i></p>

<p>Because the motions of the hands and feet are very <i>varied and

fastened a great number of <i>ligaments and muscles</i>, by which their

    MUSCLES, TENDONS, AND BONES.</div>
</div>

<p><a id="question_942"></a>942. <i>What is the constitution of a muscle?</i></p>

<p>Every muscle is made up of a number of <i>parallel fleshy fibres</i>,
or threads, which are bound together by a smooth and soft tissue,
forming a sheath or case to the muscle, and enabling it to <i>glide
freely</i> over the surfaces upon which it moves.</p>

<p class="bq">A. Lower extremity of the muscle which draws the fore-arm towards
the upper-arm, bends the elbow, raises the hand to the head, and
is powerfully exerted in pulling, lifting, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="bq">C. A muscle which gives off four long <i>tendons</i>, which pass under
the <i>ligaments</i> of the wrist, one to each finger, and by which the
fingers are bent upon the palm of the hand, as in grasping, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="bq">F. <i>Tendon</i> of a muscle which draws the little finger and the
thumb towards each other.</p>

<p>The <i>ligaments</i> may be seen enfolding the finger-joints, and also
crossing the wrist, underneath the <i>tendons</i>.</p>

<p>The muscles are compressed into <i>tendinous cords</i> at their ends, by
which they are <i>united to the bones</i>.</p>

<p>They are arranged in <i>pairs</i>, having reciprocal actions&mdash;each muscle
having <i>a companion muscle</i> by which the part which it moves is
restored to its original position, when the influence of the first
muscle is withdrawn, and the stimulus given to bring back the part.</p>

<p><a id="question_943"></a>943. <i>Why can we raise our fingers?</i></p>

<p>Because muscles which lie <i>on the fore-arm</i>, and have their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> tendons
fastened at the ends of the fingers, <i>contract</i>, and by becoming
shorter, <i>draw the fingers upward</i>, and towards the arm.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_944"></a>944. <i>Why can we throw back the fingers after they have been raised?</i></p>

<p>Because the muscles at the back of the arm, <i>whose tendons are
attached to the back of the fingers</i>, contract and restore them to
their former position.</p>

<p><a id="question_945"></a>945. <i>What degree of strength do the muscles possess?</i></p>

<p>The degree of strength of a muscle depends upon the <i>healthy
condition</i> of the muscle, the <i>amount of stimulus</i> which it receives
at the time of exertion, and the manner in which <i>its powers are
applied</i>.</p>

<p>The great muscle of the calf of the leg has been found, when removed
from a dead body, to be capable of sustaining a weight equal to
<i>seven times the weight of the entire body</i>.</p>

<p><i>But the contractile power of the living muscles</i> is very great: the
thigh bone has frequently been broken by muscular contractions in
fits of epilepsy. And in cases where there has been a dislocation
of the thigh, the head of the thigh-bone being thrown out of its
socket, (<a href="#i-229.jpg">Fig. 56</a>) it has been found necessary to employ strong ropes,
attached to a wheel turned by several hands, in order to <i>overcome
the contraction of the excited muscles, and to enable the operator to
restore the bone to its place</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_946"></a>946. <i>What is the stimulus which sets the muscles in action?</i></p>

<p>The muscles are excited to action by <i>the nerves</i>, which they receive
from the <i>spinal cord</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_947"></a>947. <i>Why does it require the influence of the will to set the arms
in motion?</i></p>

<p>Because the muscles which form their mechanism are <i>voluntary</i>
muscles&mdash;that is, they are subject to the <i>will of man</i>, and
influenced

by giving it a <i>fixed nervous influence</i>, by which it might be
unfailingly prompted to fulfil its functions.</p>

<p>If the movements of man's heart were <i>subject to his will</i>, he would
be constantly required to regard the operations of that organ; and so
large an amount of mental care and physical exertion would have to
be employed in that direction, that man's sole work would be to keep
himself alive. Hence we see the goodness of the Creator in <i>giving</i>

<p><a id="question_952"></a>952. <i>What is the spinal cord?</i></p>

<p>The spinal cord is a long and large cord of nervous matter,
which extends from the brain through a continuous tube formed by
corresponding hollows in the bones of the back. It serves as a
nervous trunk <i>for the distribution of nerves</i>, just as the aorta
distributes branches of blood-vessels.</p>

<p>Being a very vital part of the system, and from the delicacy of
its structure liable to injuries, it is set in the back-bone for
<i>protection</i>;
 and so great is its security that it is only by force
of an unusual kind that it can be injured.</p>

<p class="center bq">"Oh that men would praise the Lord for his
goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm
cvii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Let us perform a simple experiment, which will more clearly
illustrate the phenomena of <i>motion</i> and of <i>sensation</i>, which we
are now describing, than a great deal of writing upon the subject.
You hold in your hand this book: close it, and set it upon the
table; lay your hands passively upon your lap, and then <i>will</i>
your hand, to take up the book, which is the same as to say,
<i>command</i> your hand to take up the book. What occurs? The hand,
immediately obeying your desire, stretches forward to the book,
and takes hold of it. How do you know that you have hold of it?
You <i>see</i> that you have: but were your eyes closed, you would be
equally aware that the hand had reached the book, and fulfilled
your wishes. It is by the nerves of <i>sensation</i> that you are made
aware that the hand has fulfilled your instructions.</p>

<p class="bq">Consider what took place in the simple action. In the first
instance, a desire arose in your mind to take up the book. The
<i>brain</i> is the organ of the mind; and having branches either
proceeding from itself, or from the spinal cord, to every part of
the body&mdash;branches that traverse like telegraphic wires throughout
every part of the system,&mdash;it transmitted instructions along the
nerves that proceed to the muscles of the arm and hand, directing
them to take up the book. This was done instantly; and as soon
as it was done you became conscious that your will had been
obeyed&mdash;because <i>the nerves sent back a sensation to the brain
acquainting it that the book had been taken up</i>, and that at the
moment of the dispatch it was in the firm hold of the hand.</p>

<p class="bq">In all the varied motions of the body this double action of the
nerves takes place. It is obvious that without an <i>outward</i>
impulse from the brain, upon which the desire of the mind first
made an impression, no motion of the muscles of the arm and the
hand could have taken place; and it is also obvious that without
an <i>inward</i> impulse from the nerves to the brain you would not
have known that the muscles had fulfilled your instructions. The
hand might have dropped by the side of the book, or have gone too
far, or not far enough, and you would not have been aware of the
result, but for an inward communication through the nerves.</p>

<p class="bq">We are not now speaking of the nerves which endow us with the
sense of <i>feeling</i>, because they are regarded as separate and
distinct from those nerves that produce in us consciousness
of muscular response. When we walk, rise, or sit, we are made
conscious, without any special feeling being exerted, that
the muscles have placed the limb, or the body, in the desired
position, that it is set down safely and firmly, and that we may
repose upon it securely without further attention. We refer the
impressions made by the book upon the nerves of the hand, and
which enable us to tell whether it feels hot or cold, whether
its surface is rough or smooth, and so on, to the special sense
of <i>feeling</i>. The consciousness of muscular action is a separate
and distinct function; and it is generally believed that the same
nerves that convey the command of the will outward, bringing back
the intimation that the will has been obeyed, but that <i>different
fibres</i> of the nerves convey the <i>outward</i> and the <i>inward</i>
impulses. A single nerve may therefore be likened to a <i>double
wire</i> connected with the electric telegraph: one transmitting
despatches in one direction, and the other in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p><a id="question_961"></a>961. <i>What are the nerves of special sense?</i></p>

<p>The nerves of special sense are those through which we <i>hear</i>, <i>see</i>,
<i>feel</i>, <i>smell</i>, and <i>taste</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_962"></a>962. <i>What are the nerves of sympathy?</i></p>

<p>The nerves of sympathy, or the system of <i>sympathetic nerves</i>, are
those which are distributed to the <i>internal organs</i>, and which are
independent of the will. They regulate the motions of the heart, the
lungs, the stomach, &amp;c., and stimulate the organs of secretion, so
that those organs <i>work in harmony with each other</i>.</p>

<p>As the internal organs are all more or less dependent upon each
other, and unite their functions for similar ends, it is obvious
that there should prevail among them a <i>mutual consciousness</i> of
their state. Otherwise, when the stomach had formed chyme, the liver
might have no bile ready to fulfil its office; the absorbents might
be in a state of rest at the moment when nutrition was set before
them; and the heart might beat slowly, while the lungs were in active
exertion to obtain additional blood to support an active exercise.
The sympathetic system of nerves therefore <i>regulates and harmonises
these internal functions</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_963"></a>963. <i>Why do we see objects?</i></p>

<p>Because the light which is reflected from them enters our eyes and
produces images of their forms upon a membrane of nerves called the
<i>retina</i>, just as images are produced upon a mirror.</p>

<p><a id="question_964"></a>964. <i>Why does this enable us to see?</i></p>

<p>Because the membrane which receives the images of objects is
connected with the <i>optic nerve</i> which transmits to the brain
impressions made by the reflections of light, just as other nerves
convey the effects of feeling, hearing, tasting, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a id="question_965"></a>965. <i>Why are we enabled to move our eyes?</i></p>

<p>Because various muscles are so placed in relation to the eyeball,
that their contraction draws the eye in the direction required. We
are thus enabled to adjust the direction of the eye to the position
of the objects we desire to see, in other words to <i>set the mirror in
such a position that it will receive the reflection</i>. (See <a href="#question_517">517</a>.)</p>

<p><a id="question_966"></a>966. <i>Why are we enabled to see large objects upon so small a

<p>Because the lenses and humours of the eye <i>collect the rays of
light</i> coming from every direction, and, <i>bringing them into a
focus</i>, transmit them to the retina, where each ray impresses upon
the nervous surface the qualities it received from the object which
reflected it.</p>

<p><a id="question_968"></a>968. <i>Why does the pupil of the eye look black?</i></p>

<p>Because the pupil is an <i>opening</i> through which the rays of light
pass into the chamber of the eye. There is, therefore, nothing in the
pupil, of the eye to reflect light.</p>

<p>Because the field of vision is thereby <i>much extended</i>;
 the
<i>intensity</i> of sight is also increased, the impressions upon the
brain being clearer and better defined, just as in a <i>stereoscope</i>
the effect of vision is heightened by a double picture; the sense of
sight being more <i>constantly</i> exercised than any other sense during
our waking moments, <i>one eye is frequently called upon to give rest
to the other</i>;
 and the important faculty of vision, being endangered
by the necessary exposure of some parts of the eye, and the equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
necessary delicacy of an organ formed to receive impressions from
so ethereal an element as light, is rendered the more secure to us,
since though one eye may become enfeebled, diseased, or wholly lost,
<i>the other eye will retain the blessing of sight</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_971"></a>971. <i>Why, having two eyes, and each eye receiving a reflection upon
its retina, does the brain experience only one impression of an
object?</i></p>

<p>Because, besides those optical laws which bring upon the two retinas
the exactly corresponding images of the same objects, the optic
nerves <i>meet</i> before they reach the brain, <i>and blend the impulses
which they convey</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_972"></a>972. <i>Why are the eyes provided with eyelids?</i></p>

<p>Because the eyes require to be <i>defended</i> from floating particles
in the air, and to be kept <i>moist and clean</i>. The eyelids form the
shutters of the eye, defending it when waking, by closing upon its
surface whenever danger is apprehended, moistening its surface when
it becomes dry, and covering it securely during the hours of sleep.</p>

<p><a id="question_973"></a>973. <i>Why are the eyelids fringed with eyelashes?</i></p>

<p>Because the eyelashes assist to modify the light, and to protect
the eye, without actually closing the eye-ids. When the eyelids are
partially closed, as in very sunny or dusty weather, the eyelashes
cross each other, forming a kind of shady lattice-work, from the
interspaces of which the eye looks out with advantage, and sees
sufficiently for the guidance of the body.</p>

<p><a id="question_974"></a>974. <i>Why are we able to see at long or short distances?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>crystalline lens</i> of the eye is a moveable body, and is
pushed forward, or drawn back by fine muscular fibres, according to
the distances of the objects upon which we look. By these means its
<i>focus</i> becomes adjusted.</p>

<p><a id="question_975"></a>975. <i>Why do we wink?</i></p>

<p>Because, by the repeated action of winking, <i>the eye is kept moist
and clean</i>, and the watery fluid secreted by little glands in the
eyelids, and at the sides of the eye, is spread equally over the
surface, instead of being allowed to accumulate. But the action of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
winking, or brightening the eye, is so instantaneous that it does not
impede the sight.</p>

<p><a id="question_977"></a>977. <i>Why do tears form in the eyes?</i></p>

<p>Because, under the emotions of the mind, the circulation of blood
in the brain, and in its nearest branches, becomes considerably
quickened. The eyes receive a larger amount of blood, and the
secretion of the lachrymal glands being increased, the fluid
overflows, and tears are formed. The use of tears is probably <i>to
keep the eyes cool during the excitement of the brain</i>. They are
formed also during <i>laughing</i>, but less frequently.</p>

<p><a id="question_978"></a>978. <i>Why do we feel inconvenienced by sudden light?</i></p>

<p>Because an excess of light enters the eye before the <i>iris</i> has had

<p><a id="question_979"></a>979. <i>Why if we look upon a very bright light, and then turn away,

<p>Because the <i>iris</i> has so reduced the pupil while we were looking at

<i>the pupil is too small</i> to admit sufficient rays to enable us to see.</p>

words,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> that there are some rays which are luminous to them which

<p><a id="question_983"></a>983. <i>Why do we hear?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>tympanum</i> of the ear <i>receives impressions from sounds</i>,
and transmits those impressions to the brain in a similar manner to
that in which the retina of the eye transmits the impressions made
upon it by light.</p>

<p><a id="question_984"></a>984. <i>Why is one part of the ear spread out externally?</i></p>

<p>The external ear is a <i>natural ear-trumpet</i>, and serves to collect
the vibrations of sound, and to conduct them towards the internal ear.</p>

<p><a id="question_985"></a>985. <i>Why is the ear allowed to project, whilst the eye is carefully
enclosed?</i></p>

<p>Because the external ear, being formed of tough cartilaginous
substance, and being very simple in its organisation, is but little
liable to injury.</p>

<p><a id="question_986"></a>986. <i>Why do hairs grow across the entrance of the ears?</i></p>

<p>Because they prevent the intrusion of insects, and of particles of
dust, by which otherwise the faculty of hearing would be impaired.</p>

<p class="bq">The insect called the <i>earwig</i> is popularly supposed to be so
named from its tendency to get into the human ear, and cause pain
and madness by penetrating to the brain. An earwig, however, is no
more likely to get into the ear than any other insect whose habit
it is to penetrate the corollas of flowers; and should an insect
enter the ear, it could get no further than the <i>membrane of the
tympanum</i>, which spreads all over the auditory passage, just as
the parchment of a drum spreads over the entire circumference of
that instrument. The fact is, that the wing of the insect, when
spread, <i>resembles the external ear</i> in shape. It is similar to
the wing of the stag beetle (<i>see</i> illustration), and this fancied
resemblance of the wing of the insect to the ear of man may have
given rise to the name of <i>ear-wing</i>, which became corrupted to
<i>earwig</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_989"></a>989. <i>Why do people become deaf?</i></p>

<p>Because the ear may be injured in various ways: the tympanum may be
impaired, the fluid of the ear dried up, or the nerves be pressed
upon by swellings in the surrounding parts. When, therefore, the
<i>mechanism of hearing</i> is impaired, the sense of hearing becomes
weakened, or altogether lost.</p>

<p><a id="question_990"></a>990. <i>Why do persons accustomed to loud noises feel no inconvenience
from them?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>sensitiveness</i> of the nerves of the ear becomes
deadened. They do not convey to the brain such intense impulses when
they are frequently acted upon by loud sounds.</p>

<p><a id="question_991"></a>991. <i>Why do persons engaged in battle often lose their hearing?</i></p>

<p>Because the vibrations caused by the sounds of artillery are so
violent that they overpower the mechanism of the ear, and frequently
<i>rupture the connection of the fine nervous filaments</i> with the
textures through which they spread.</p>

<p class="bq">The violent concussions of the air produced by volleys of cannon,
or by loud peals of thunder, have an overpowering effect upon
persons nervously constituted, and upon the organ of hearing,
which is more especially affected. As persons have been struck
blind by intense light, so others have been deafened by intense
sounds. In 1697 a butcher's dog was killed by the noise of the
firing to celebrate the proclamation of peace. Two troops of
horse were dismounted, and drawn up in a line to fire volleys. At
the moment of the first volley a large and courageous mastiff,
belonging to a butcher, was lying asleep before the fire. At
the noise of the first volley the dog started up, and ran into
another room, where it hid itself behind a bed; on the firing of
the second volley, it ran several times bout the room, trembling
violently; and when the third volley was fired it ran around once
or twice with great violence, and then dropped down dead, with
blood flowing from its mouth and nose. Persons who are painfully
affected by loud noises should put a little wool in their ears
when such noises are occurring; they will thereby save themselves
from temporary inconvenience, and probably preserve the sense of
hearing from permanent injury.</p>

<p>Because minute particles of matter, diffused in the air, come in

<p><a id="question_996"></a>996. <i>Why do we taste?</i></p>

<p>Because the tongue is endowed with <i>gustatory</i> nerves, having the
function of <i>taste</i> as their <i>special sense</i>, just as the <i>optic</i>,
the <i>auditory</i>, and the <i>olfactory</i> nerves, have their special duties
in the eyes, ears, and nose.</p>

<p><a id="question_997"></a>997. <i>Why do some substances taste sweet, others sour, others salt,

<p>It is believed that the impressions of taste arise from the various

<p><a id="question_998"></a>998. <i>Why do we taste substances most satisfactorily after they have
remained a little while in the mouth?</i></p>

<p>Because the nerves of taste are most abundantly distributed to the
under surface of the tongue; and when solid substances have been in
the mouth a little while, they impregnate the saliva of the mouth
with their particles <i>and come in contact in a fluid solution with
the gustatory nerves</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_999"></a>999. <i>Why if we put a nub of sugar to the tip of the tongue has it no

<p><a id="question_1001"></a>1001. <i>Through what nerves are we made sensible of the contact of

<p><a id="question_1002"></a>1002. <i>Why do connoisseurs of wines close their mouths and distend

<p><a id="question_1003"></a>1003. <i>Why do they also pass the fumes of the wines through their
nostrils?</i></p>

<p>Because <i>flavour</i>, in its fullest sense, comprehends not only the
<i>taste</i>, but the <i>odour</i> of a substance; and, therefore, persons of
experience attend to both requisites.</p>

<p>The various conditions of taste are defined to be:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Where sensations of <i>touch</i> are alone produced, as by glass, ice,
pebbles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Where, in addition to being <i>felt</i> upon the tongue, the substance
excites sensation in the <i>olfactory nerves</i>, as by lead, tin, copper,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Where, besides being <i>felt</i>, there are peculiar sensations of
<i>taste</i>, expressive of the properties of bodies, as salt, sugar,
tartaric acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. Where, besides being <i>felt</i> and <i>tasted</i>, there is an <i>odour</i>
characteristic of the substance, and essential to the full
development of its flavours, as in cloves, lemon-peel, caraway-seed,
and aromatic substances generally.</p>

<p><a id="question_1004"></a>1004. <i>Why do we feel?</i></p>

<p>Because there are distributed to various parts of the body fine
nervous filaments, which have for their special duty the transmission
to the brain of impressions made upon them <i>by contact</i> with
substances.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1005"></a>1005. <i>In what parts of the body does the sense of touch more
especially reside?</i></p>

<p>In the points of the fingers and in the tongue. By laying a piece of
paper upon a table, and upon the paper a piece of cloth, on the piece
of cloth a bit of silk, and on the bit of silk a piece of leather, so
that the edge of each would be exposed to the extent of half-an-inch,
it would be possible by the touch to tell when the finger passed
successively over the leather, silk, cloth, or paper, and arrived on
the table.</p>

<p>Those impressions of touch must have been communicated, with their
extremely nice distinctions, to the sensitive nerves that lie
underneath the skin, and must have been transmitted all the way
through the arm to the brain, although the touch itself was so light
as scarcely to be appreciable with regard to the force applied.</p>

<p>A hair lying on the tongue will be plainly perceptible to the touch
of the tongue; and the surface of a broken tooth will often cause the
tongue great annoyance, by the acute perception it imparts of the
roughness of its surface.</p>

<p>The toes are also highly sensitive, though their powers of touch are
seldom fully developed. Persons who have lost their arms, however,
have brought their feet to be almost as sensitive as fingers. Blind
persons increase, by constant exercise, their powers of touch to such
a degree that they are able to read freely by passing their fingers
over embossed printing; and they have been known to distinguish
<i>colours</i> by differences in their grain, quite unappreciable by other
persons.</p>

<p><a id="question_1006"></a>1006. <i>Why is feeling impaired when the hands are cold?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the blood flows slowly to the nerves, they are less
capable of that perception of touch which is their <i>special sense</i>.
The skin contracts upon the nervous filaments, and <i>impairs the
contact</i> between them and the bodies which they touch.</p>

<p><a id="question_1007"></a>1007. <i>Why do the fingers prick and sting when they again become
warm?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the warmth expands the cuticle, and the blood begins to
flow more freely through the vessels, <i>the nerves are made conscious
of the movements of the blood</i>, and continue to be so until the
circulation is equally restored to all the parts.</p>

<p>Because the nervous trunk which formerly conveyed impressions from
those extremities remains in the part of the limb attached to the
body. <i>The mind has been accustomed to refer the impulses received
through that nervous trunk to the extremity where the sensations
arose.</i> And now that the nerve has been cut, the painful sensation
caused thereby is referred to the extremity which the nerve supplied,
and the sufferers for a time appear to <i>continue to feel the part
which they have lost</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1009"></a>1009. <i>Why do we perspire?</i></p>

<p>Because the skin is filled with very <i>minute pores</i>, which act as
outlets for a portion of the water of the blood, that serves to
<i>moisten and cool</i> the surface of the body, and to carry away some of
the matter <i>no longer needed in the system</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1010"></a>1010. <i>How is the perspiration formed?</i></p>

<p>By very small <i>glands</i>, which lie embedded in the skin. It is
estimated that there are about 2,700,000 perspiratory glands
distributed over the surface of the body, and that these glands find
outlets for their secretion through no less than <i>seven millions of
pores</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1011"></a>1011. <i>What is insensible perspiration?</i></p>

<p>Insensible perspiration is that <i>transmission of watery particles
through the skin</i> which is constantly going on, but which takes place
so gently that it cannot be perceived. It is, however, very important
in its results, as no less than <i>from twenty to thirty-three ounces
of water may pass imperceptibly through the skin in twenty-four
hours</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Sensible perspiration is that moisture which exudes upon the skin <i>in

exercise or other means.</p>

<p><a id="question_1013"></a>1013. <i>Why does a sudden change from heat to cold bring on illness?</i></p>

<p>Because the effect of cold <i>arrests the action of the vessels of the
skin</i>, and suddenly throws upon the internal organs the excretory
labour which the skin should have sustained.</p>

<p><a id="question_1014"></a>1014. <i>Why does a chill upon the skin frequently produce inflammation
of the lungs?</i></p>

<p>Because the lungs and the skin together discharge the chief
proportion of the watery fluid of the body. <i>When the skin's action
is checked, the lungs have to throw off a much greater amount of
fluid.</i> The lungs, therefore, become <i>over worked</i>, and inflammatory
action sets in.</p>

<p><a id="question_1015"></a>1015. <i>Why does cleanliness promote health?</i></p>

<p>Because every atom of dirt which lodges upon the surface of the body
serves to clog and check the working of those <i>minute pores</i>, by
which much of the fluid of the body is changed and purified.</p>

<p>In the internal parts of the system, the Creator has made ample
provision for cleanliness. Every organ is so constituted that it
cleanses and lubricates itself. Every surface of the inner body is
perfectly clean, and as soft as silk.</p>

<p>Nature leaves to man the care of those surfaces which are under
his immediate observation and controul; and he who, from idleness,
or indifference to nature's laws, is guilty of personal neglect,
<i>opposes the evident intentions of the Creator</i>, and must sooner or
later pay the penalty of disobedience.</p>

<p><a id="question_1016"></a>1016. <i>Why does exercise promote health?</i></p>

<p>Because it <i>assists all the functions upon which life depend</i>. It
quickens the circulation, and thereby nourishes every part of the
body, causing the bones to become firm, and the muscles to become
full and healthy. It promotes breathing, by which oxygen is taken
into the system, and carbon thrown off, and thereby it produces a
higher degree of organic life and strength than would otherwise
exist. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> promotes perspiration, by which, through the millions
of pores of the skin, much of the fluid of the body is changed and
purified. And it induces that genial and diffused warmth, which is
one of the chief conditions of a high degree of vitality.</p>

<p><a id="question_1017"></a>1017. <i>Why do we feel fatigue?</i></p>

<p>Because those organs which stimulate the mechanism of the body to
act, <i>themselves require rest and repair</i>. When the brain and nerves
arrive at that state, they make their condition known to the system
generally, by indications which we denominate <i>fatigue</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1018"></a>1018. <i>Why, after rest, do we return invigorated to our labours?</i></p>

<p>Because the nervous system has accumulated, during the hours of rest,
a fresh amount of that <i>vital force</i> which we call the nervous fluid,
and by which the various organs of the body are excited to perform
the duties assigned to them.</p>

<p><a id="question_1019"></a>1019. <i>What is sleep?</i></p>

<p>Sleep is understood to be that state of the body in which <i>the
relation of the brain to some parts of the body is temporarily
suspended</i>.</p>

<p>There are some parts of the body that <i>never sleep</i>: such are the
heart, the lungs, the organs of circulation, and those parts of the
nervous system that direct their operations.</p>

<p>But when sleep overtakes the system, it seems as if the <i>relations</i>
of those parts under the controul of the will were temporarily
suspended; as if, for instance, those nerves which move the arms, the
legs, the eyes, the tongue, &amp;c., were all at once unfastened, just as
the strings of an instrument are relaxed by the turning of a key, or
the throwing down of a bridge over which they were stretched.</p>

<p class="bq">What is meant by the temporary suspension of the relation of the
brain to some parts of the body, may be thus explained. Notice
a man when he sits dosing in a chair: at first his head is held
up, the brain controlling the muscles of the neck, and keeping
the head erect. But drowsiness comes on, the brain begins to
withdraw its influence, and the muscles of the neck becoming as
it were "unstrung," the head drops down upon the breast. But the
sleep is unsound, and disturbed by surrounding noises. The brain
is therefore frequently excited to return its influence to the
muscles, and draw up the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the sleeper. He gives a sudden
start, every muscle is tightened in an instant, up goes the head,
the eyes open, the ears listen, until a feeling of security
and composure returns; the sleep again deepens, <i>the nervous
connection is again withdrawn</i>, and then down drops the head as
before.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little
folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that
travelleth; and thy want as an armed man."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs xxv.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1020"></a>1020. <i>Why do we dream?</i></p>

<p>Dreams appear to arise <i>from the excitement of the brain during those
hours when its connection with the other parts of the living organism
is suspended</i>. For instance: a man dreams that he is pursued by a
furious animal, and the mind passes through all the excitement of
flying from danger; but the <i>connection</i> between the moving power,
and the machinery of motion being suspended, no motion takes place.
The same impressions upon the brain, when the nerves were "strung" to
the muscles, would have caused a rapid flight, and a vigorous effort
to escape from the apprehended danger.</p>

<p><a id="question_1021"></a>1021. <i>Why do suppers, when indigestible substances are eaten,
produce dreaming?</i></p>

<p>Probably because, as the digestive organs are oppressed, and those
parts of the nervous system which stimulate the organs of digestion
are <i>excited by excessive action</i>, those portions of the brain which
are not immediately employed by the digestive process are disturbed
by that <i>sympathy</i> which is observed to prevail between the relative
parts and functions of the body.</p>

<p><a id="question_1022"></a>1022. <i>Why do we yawn?</i></p>

<p>Because, as we become weary, the nervous impulses which direct the
respiratory movements are enfeebled. It has been said that those
movements are involuntary, and that the parts engaged in producing
them are not subject to fatigue. But the operation of breathing
is, <i>to some extent, voluntary</i>, though when we cease to direct it
voluntarily, it is involuntarily continued by organs which know no
fatigue.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we feel weary&mdash;still controuling our breathing in
our efforts to move or to speak&mdash;there frequently arrives a period
when, for a few seconds, the respiratory process is suspended. It
seems to be the point at which the voluntary nerves of respiration
are about to deliver their office over to the involuntary nerves;
but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> the pause in the respiration has caused a momentary deficiency
of breath, and the involuntary nerves of respiration, coming suddenly
to the aid of the lungs, cause a spasmodic action of the parts
involved, and <i>a yawn</i>, attended by a <i>deep inspiration to compensate
for the cessation of breathing</i>, are the result.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And it shall be, when they say unto thee,
Wherefore sighed thou that thou shalt answer, For the tidings,
because it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be
feeble."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezekiel xxi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1023"></a>1023. <i>Why do we cough?</i></p>

<p>Because the respiratory organs are excited by the presence of some
body foreign or unnatural to them. A cough is an effort on the part
of the air tubes to free themselves from some source of irritation.
And so important are the organs of breathing to the welfare of the
body, that the muscles of the chest, back, and abdomen, <i>unite in the
endeavour to get rid of the exciting substance</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1024"></a>1024. <i>Why do we sneeze?</i></p>

<p>Because particles of matter enter the nostrils and excite the nerves
of feeling and of smell. In sneezing, as in coughing, the effort is
to free the parts affected from the intrusion of some matters of an
objectionable nature. And in this case, as in the former one, there
is a very general sympathy of other organs with the part affected,
and an energetic effort to get rid of the evil.</p>

<p><a id="question_1025"></a>1025. <i>Why do we sigh?</i></p>

<p>The action of sighing arises from very similar causes to those of
yawning. But in sighing, the nervous depression is caused by <i>grief</i>;

while in yawning, it is the result of <i>fatigue</i>. In sighing, the
effect is generally erased by an <i>expiration</i>&mdash;in yawning by an
<i>inspiration</i>. The mind, wearied and weakened by sorrow, omits for a
few seconds to continue the respiratory process; and then suddenly
there comes an involuntary expiration of the breath, causing a faint
sound as it passes the organs of the voice.</p>

<p><a id="question_1026"></a>1026. <i>Why do we laugh?</i></p>

<p>Laughing is caused by the very opposite influences that produce
sighing. The nervous system is highly excited by some external cause.
The impression is so intense, and the mind so fixed upon it, that the
respiratory process is irregular, and uncontrolled. Persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> excited
to a fit of laughter generally hold their breath until they can hold
it no longer, and then suddenly there is a quick expiration causing
eccentric sounds, the mind being too intently fixed upon the cause
of excitement, <i>either to moderate the sounds, or to controul the
breathing</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1027"></a>1027. <i>Why do we hiccough?</i></p>

<p>Hiccough is caused by a spasmodic twitching of the diaphragm, a
thin muscular membrane which divides the chest from the abdomen. It
generally arises from sympathy with the stomach; and it is highly
probable that the muscular twitches and jerks are so many efforts on
the part of the diaphragm to <i>assist the stomach to get rid of some
undigested matter</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1028"></a>1028. <i>Why do we snore?</i></p>

<p>Snoring is caused by air sweeping through the passages that lead from
the mouth through the nostrils, and which, in our waking moments,
are capable of certain muscular modifications to adapt them to our
breathing. But as in sleeping the nervous controul over them is
withdrawn, they are left to the action of the air which, in sweeping
by them, <i>sets them in vibration</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">We have endeavoured, by the employment of the simplest language,
and by reference to some of the most familiar phenomena of nature,
to impart to the reader a clear conception of those sublime laws
which control our being, and afford evidence of the goodness and
power of that Almighty God to whom we are indebted for the life
that we enjoy, and the varied and beautiful existences which, to
the rightly constituted mind, make the earth a vast aggregation of
interesting objects. We will now, before we pass on to the final
section of our work, review some of the more important facts that
have been communicated, and devote a few pages to meditations upon
the formation of the human body&mdash;that wonderful temple of which
each of us is a tenant.</p>

<p class="bq">We have described man's organisation. What is that organisation
for? <i>It is to make use of the elements upon which man exists.</i>
The lungs make use of the air; the eye makes use of the light;
the stomach, and the system generally, make use of water; every
part of the body uses heat; and all parts of the system demand
food. The hand feeds as constantly as the mouth. The mouth is the
receptacle of food, by which the body is to be fed; the stomach is
the kitchen in which food is prepared for the use of the body; and
the blood-vessels are the canals through which the food is sent to
those members of the body that are in need of it. When we speak
of man's "organs" or "members," we speak of those parts of the
living machinery by which the elements are used up, or employed,
for man's benefit. And this view of the subject, bearing in mind
that the body is held together as the temple of a living Spirit,
superior to mere flesh and blood, gives us a higher and clearer
perception of the distinction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
between the body and the soul than
that which we might otherwise entertain. The body is a machine,
working for the spirit, which is its owner. While the machine
works, the spirit directs and influences its actions. But when the
machine stops, the spirit resigns its power over a ruined temple,
quits it, and flies to a region where, as a spirit, it becomes
subject to a new order of existence consistent with its severance
from earthly things and laws, and there it enters upon its eternal
destiny, according to the judgments and appointments of God. It is
no longer dependent upon a relation between spiritual and material
laws.</p>

unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Suppose that the air which man breathes, instead of returning
from his lungs clear and imperceptible to sight, were tinged with
colour; we should see, that every time a man breathed, the air
would rush in a stream into his mouth, and then return again;
and the air which returned would, being warm, be lighter than
the outer air, and would rise upward over the man's head, where,
cooling and mingling with the outer air, it would descend again.
We do, in fact, see this action evidenced; when in winter time the
cold condenses the vapour of the breath, we see the little cloud
constantly rising before the breather's face, and dispersing in
the surrounding air.</p>

<p class="bq">Is it not a wonderful thing that that clear and elastic substance,
which you cannot feel, though it touches every part of your body,
and which you cannot see, is composed of two distinct bodies,
having very different properties; and that the two bodies can
easily be separated from each other?</p>

<p class="bq">Air is of the first importance to life. Hence it is provided
for us everywhere. We require air every second, water every few
hours, and food at intervals considerably apart. Air is therefore
provided for us everywhere. Whether we stand or sit; whether we
dwell in a valley or upon a mountain; whether we go into the
cellar under our house, or into the garret at the top of it, air
is there provided for us. God, who made it a law that man should
breathe to live, also sent him air abundantly, that he might
comply with that law. And all that is required from man in this
respect is, that he will not shut out God's bounty, but receive it
freely.</p>

<p class="bq">As we have employed the idea that if the air were coloured we
should have the opportunity of marking the process of breathing,
let us enlarge upon this, and suppose that every time the air were
returned from the lungs it became of a darker colour, the darkness
denoting increasing impurity. If we placed a man in a room full
of pure air, we should see the air enter his lungs, and sent back
slightly tinged; but this would disperse itself with the other
air of the room and scarcely be perceptible. As the man continued
to breathe, however, each measure of air returning from the lungs
would serve to pollute that abiding in the room, until at last the
whole mass would become cloudy and discoloured, and we should see
such a change as occurs when water is turned from a pure and clear
state into a muddy condition. The air does become polluted with
each respiration, and although it is colourless, it is as impure
as if with every breath given off from the lungs it became of a
dark colour in proportion to its impurity.</p>

<p class="bq">Thus we see how important it is that we should provide ourselves
with pure air; and that, in seeking warmth and comfort in
our houses, we should provide an adequate supply of fresh
atmosphere&mdash;because it is more vital to life than either water or
food.</p>

<p class="bq">Indeed, so constant is our requirement of air, that <i>if we had
to fetch it, for</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
<i>purposes of breathing, or simply to raise it
to our mouths, as we do water when we drink, it would be the
sole occupation of our lives&mdash;we could do nothing else</i>. For
this reason, God has sent the air to us, and not required us to
go to the air. And the great error of man is, that in too many
instances, he shuts off the supply from himself, and brings on
disease and pain by inhaling a poisonous compound, instead of air
of a healthful kind, which bears an adaptation to the wants of
life.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"There is a natural body, and there is a
spiritual body."&mdash;<span class="smcap">I Corinthians xv.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Whilst the rooms of our house are filled with air, it is otherwise
with water, which we require in less degree than air. If we have
not the artificial means by which water is brought to our houses,
through the pipes of a water company, there is a spring or a pump
in the garden; or in the absence of these, a good sound cask,
standing at the end of our house, forming a receptacle to the
water-pipes that surround it, provides us with a supply of water
distilled from the clouds. If we were to drink a good draught of
water once a day, that would be sufficient for all the purposes
of life, as far as regards the alimentary uses of water. Man is,
therefore, allowed to go to the stream for his drink, and is
required to raise it to his lips at those moments when he uses it.</p>

<p class="bq">Although, in breathing, man separates the <i>oxygen</i> of the air from
the <i>nitrogen</i> thereof, he does not separate the <i>oxygen</i> of the
water from the <i>hydrogen</i>. Water, in fact, undergoes no change
in the body, excepting that of admixture with the substances of
the body. And its uses are, to moisten, to cool, to cleanse, and
also to nourish the parts with which it comes in contact. But it
affords no nourishment of itself; it mixes with the blood, of
which it forms a material part, and is the means of conveying <i>the
nourishment of the blood</i> to every part of the system. After it
has filled this office, and taken up impurities that are required
to be removed, it is cast out of the system again, without
undergoing any chemical change.</p>

<p class="bq">Man's body is to his Soul, in many respects, what a house is to
its occupant. But how superior is the dwelling which God erected,
to that which man has built. Reader, come out of yourself, and in
imagination realise the abstraction of the Soul from the body.
Make an effort of thought, and do not relinquish that effort,
until you fancy that you see your image seated on a chair before
you. And now proceed to ask yourself certain questions respecting
your bodily tenement&mdash;questions which, perchance, have never
occurred to you before; but which will impress themselves the more
forcibly upon you, in proportion as you realise for a moment the
idea of your Soul examining the body which it inhabits. There sits
before you a form of exquisite proportions, with reference to the
mode of life it has to pursue&mdash;the wants of the Soul for which it
has to care, and which it has to guard, under the direction of
that Soul, its owner and master.</p>

<p class="bq">Over the brows that mark the intellectual front of that due
form, there fall the auburn locks of youth, or the grey hair of
venerable age. Each of those hairs is curiously organised. If you
take a branch of a tree, and cut it across, you will find curious
markings caused by vessels of various structure, all necessary to
the existence of the plant. In the centre will be found either
a hollow tube, or a space occupied by a soft substance called
pith. Each hair of your head is as curiously formed as the branch
of a tree, and in a manner not dissimilar, though its parts
are so minute that the unaided eye cannot discern them. Every
hair has a root, just as a tree has, and through this root it
receives its nourishment. As the vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
which feed a plant are
always proportionate to the size of the plant itself, how fine
must be those vessels which form the roots of the hair, being in
proportion to the size of the hair, which is in itself so small
that the eye cannot see its structure? The hair is, in fact, an
animal plant, growing upon the body in much the same manner that
plants grow upon the surface of the earth. But how does this hair
grow? Not alone by the addition of matter at its roots, pushing up
and elongating its stem: nourishment passes up through its whole
length, and is deposited upon its end, just as the nourishment of
a tree is deposited upon its extreme branches. If, after having
your hair cut, you were to examine its ends by the microscope, you
would discover the abrupt termination left by the scissors. But
allow the hair to grow, and then examine it, and you will discover
that it grows from its point which, in comparison with its former
state, is perfect and fine. The reason why the beard is so hard
is, that the ends of the hair are continually being shaved off.
The hair of the beard, if allowed to grow, would become almost as
soft as the hair of the head.

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"The very hairs of your head are all
numbered."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew xi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">But why is man's head thus covered with hair? For precisely the
same reason that a house is thatched&mdash;to keep the inmates warm.
We might add, also, to give beauty to the edifice. But as beauty
is a conventional quality&mdash;and if men were without it they would
consider themselves quite as handsome as they do now&mdash;we will not
enlarge upon the argument. Our bald-headed friends, too, might
have reason to complain of such a partial hypothesis. The brain
is the great organ upon which the health, the welfare, and the
happiness of the system depends. The skull, therefore, may be
regarded as analogous to the "strong box," the iron chest in which
the merchant keeps his treasure. There is no point at which the
brain can be touched to its injury, without first doing violence
to the skull. Even the spinal cord runs down the back through a
tunnel or tube, formed in a number of strong bones, so closely
and firmly jointed together, that they are commonly termed "the
back-bone."</p>

<p class="bq">Look at the eyebrows. What purpose do they fulfil? Precisely that
of a shed, or arch placed over a window to shelter it from rain.
But for the eyebrows the perspiration would frequently run from
the brow into the eyes, and obscure the sight; a man walking in a
shower of rain would scarcely be able to see; and a mariner in a
storm would find a double difficulty in braving the tempest.</p>

<p class="bq">Now we come to the eye, which is the window of the Soul's abode.
And what a window! how curiously constructed! how wisely guarded!
In the eyelashes, as well as the eyebrows, we see the hair
fulfilling a useful purpose, differing from any already described.
The eyelashes serve to keep cold winds, dust, and too bright
sun, from injuring or entering the windows of the body. When we
walk against the east wind, we bring the tips of our eyelashes
together, and in that way exclude the cold air from the surface
of the eye; and in the same manner we exclude the dust and modify
the light. The eyelashes, therefore, are like so many sentries,
constantly moving to and fro, protecting a most important organ
from injury. The eyelids are the shutters by which the windows
are opened and closed. But they also cleanse the eye, keeping it
bright and moist. There are, moreover, in the lids of each eye
or window, little glands, or springs, by which a clear fluid is
formed and supplied for cleansing the eye. The eye is placed in a
socket of the skull, in which it has free motion, turning right
or left, up or down, to serve the purpose of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
inhabitant of
the dwelling. Of the structure of the eye itself we will not say
much, for the engravings will afford a clearer understanding than
a lengthy written description. But we would have you examine the
formation of the iris of the living eye, the ring which surrounds
the pupil. Hold a light to it, and you will find that the iris
will contract and diminish the pupil; withdraw the light, and the
iris will relax, and the pupil expand, thus regulating the amount
of light. The images of external objects are formed upon the
retina of the eye, a thin membrane, spread out upon the extremity
of a large nerve, which proceeds immediately to the brain, and
forms the telegraphic cord by which information is given to the
mind, of everything visible going on within the range of sight.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Now, think for a few moments upon the wonderful structure of those
windows of the body. Can you fancy, in the walls of your house, a
window which protects itself, cleanses itself, and turns in any
direction at the mere will of the tenant; and when that tenant is
oppressed by excess of light, draws its own curtain, and gives
him ease; and when he falls asleep, closes its own shutters, and
protects itself from the cold and dust of night, and the instant
he awakes in the morning, opens, cleanses itself with a fluid
which it has prepared during the night, and kept in readiness; and
repeats this routine of duty day after day for half a century,
without becoming impaired? Such, nevertheless, is the wonderful
structure of the window of the body&mdash;the eye.</p>

<p class="bq">In some scientific works that have recently been published,
curious investigations have been made known. It has been shown
that the eye is impressed momentarily, as a photographic plate
is impressed by the rays of the sun. But the photography of the
eye has this extraordinary quality&mdash;that one image passes away,
and another takes its place immediately, without confusion or
indistinctness. But the most wonderful assertion of all is, that
under the excitement of memory these photographic images are
restored; and that when, "in our mind's eye," we see the image
of some dear departed friend, the retina really revives an image
which once fell upon its sensitive surface, and which image has
been stored up for many years in the sacred portfolio of its
affections!</p>

<p class="bq">Another extraordinary assertion is one which comes supported by
a degree of authenticity that entitles it to consideration. It
is said that the eye of a dead man retains an impression of the
last picture that fell upon the faithful retina. Dr. Sandford, of
America, examined the eye of a man named Beardley, who had been
murdered at Auburn, and he published in the <i>Boston Atlas</i> the
following statement:&mdash;"At first we suggested the saturation of the
eye in a weak solution of atrophine, which evidently produced an
enlarged state of the pupil. On observing this, we touched the end
of the optic nerve with the extract, when the eye instantly became
protuberant. We now applied a powerful lens, and discovered in the
pupil, the rude, worn-away figure of a man, with a light coat,
beside whom was a round stone, standing or suspended in the air,
with a small handle, stuck in the earth. The remainder was debris,
evidently lost from the destruction of the optic nerve, and its
separation from the mother brain. Had we performed the operation
when the eye was entire in the socket, with all its powerful
connection with the brain, there is not the least doubt but that
we should have detected the last idea and impression made on the
mind and eye of the unfortunate man. The picture would evidently
be entire; and perhaps we should have had the contour, or better
still, the exact figure of the murderer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
The last impression on
the brain before death is always more terrible from fear than any
other cause, and figures impressed on the pupil more distinct,
which we attribute to the largeness of the optic nerve, and its
free communication with the brain." Whether the supposition, which
seems to be supported by the experiment above detailed, be correct
or not, it is in no sense more wonderful than the facts which are
already known respecting this curious and perfect organ.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">The nose is given us for two purposes&mdash;to enable us to respire and
to smell. As odours arise from the surface of the earth, the cup
or funnel of the nose is turned down to meet them. In the nostrils
hair again serves a useful purpose. It not only warms the air
which enters the nostrils, but it springs out from all sides, and
forms an intersecting net, closing the nostrils against dust, and
the intrusion of small insects. If by any means, as when taking
a sharp sniff, foreign matters enter the nostrils, the nose is
armed with a set of nerves which communicate the fact to certain
muscles, and the organs of respiration unite with those muscles to
expel the intruding substances. In this action, the diaphragm, or
the muscle which divides the abdomen from the chest, is pressed
down, the lungs are filled with air, the passage by which that
air would otherwise escape through the mouth, is closed up, and
then, all at once, with considerable force, the air is pressed
through the nostrils, to free them from the annoying substance. So
great is the force with which this action takes place, that the
passage into the mouth is generally pushed open occasioning the
person in whom the action takes place, to cry "'tsha!" and thus
is formed what is termed a sneeze. As with the eye, so with the
nose&mdash;innumerable nerves are distributed over the lining membrane,
and these nerves are connected with larger nerves passing to the
brain, through which everything relating to the sense of smell is
communicated.</p>

<p class="bq">The nose acts like a custom-house officer to the system. It is
highly sensitive to the odour of most poisonous substances. It
readily detects hemlock, henbane, monk's hood, and the plants
containing prussic acid. It recognises the f&oelig;ted smell of
drains, and warns us not to breathe the polluted air. The nose
is so sensitive, that air containing a 200,000th part of bromine
vapour will instantly be detected by it. It will recognise the
1,300,000th part of a grain of otto of roses, or the 13,000,000th
part of a grain of musk! It tells us in the mornings that our
bed-rooms are impure; it catches the first fragrance of the
morning air, and conveys to us the invitation of the flowers to go
forth into the fields, and inhale their sweet breath. To be "led
by the nose," has hitherto been used as a phrase of reproach. But
to have a good nose, and to follow its guidance, is one of the
safest and shortest ways to the enjoyment of health.</p>

<p class="bq">The mouth answers the fourfold purpose of the organ of taste,
of sound, of mastication, and of breathing. In all of these
operations, except in breathing, the various parts of the mouth
are engaged. In eating we use the lips, the tongue, and the teeth.
The teeth serve the purpose of grinding the food, the tongue
turns it during the process of grinding, and delivers it up to
the throat for the purposes of the stomach, when sufficiently
masticated. The lips serve to confine the food in the mouth, and
assist in swallowing it, and there are glands underneath the
tongue, and in the sides of the mouth, which pour in a fluid
to moisten the food. And so watchful are those glands of their
duty, that the mere imagination frequently causes them to act.
Their fluid is required to modify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the intensity of different
flavours and condiments in which man, with his love of eating,
will indulge. Thus, when we eat anything very acid, as a lemon, or
anything very irritating, as Cayenne pepper, the effect thereof
upon the sensitive nerves of the tongue is greatly modified by a
free flow of saliva into the mouth. And if we merely fancy the
taste of any such things, those glands are so watchful, that they
will immediately pour out their fluid to mitigate the supposed
effect.</p>

<p class="center bq">"I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by
heaven, for it is God's throne; Nor by the earth; for it is his
footstool."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Matthew v.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">In speaking, we use the lips, the teeth, the tongue; and the
chest supplies air, which, being controlled in its emission, by
a delicate apparatus at the mouth of the wind-pipe, causes the
various sounds which we have arranged into speech, and by which,
under certain laws, we are enabled to understand each other's
wants, participate in each other's emotions, express our loves,
our hopes, our fears, and glean those facts, the accumulation of
which constitutes knowledge, enhances the happiness of man, and
elevates him, in its ultimate results above the lower creatures to
which the blessing of speech is denied.</p>

<p class="bq">The curious structure of the tongue, and the organs of speech,
would fill a very interesting volume. The tongue is unfortunately
much abused, not only by those who utter foul words, and convert
the blessing of speech, which should improve and refine, into
a source of wicked and profane language; but it constantly
remonstrates against the abuse of food, and the use of things
which are not only unnecessary for the good of our bodies, but
prejudicial to their health. When the body is sufficiently fed,
the tongue ceases its relish, and derives no more satisfaction
from eating: but man contrives a variety of inventions to whip the
tongue up to an unnatural performance of its duty, and thus we not
only over-eat, but eat things that have no more business in our
stomachs, than have the stones that we walk upon. Can we wonder,
then, that disease is so prevalent, and that death calls for many
of us so soon.</p>

<p class="bq">That wonderful essence, the Soul of man, rises above all finite
knowledge. Its wonders and powers will never, probably, be
understood until when, in a future state of existence, the
grandest of all mysteries shall be explained. When we talk of the
brain, we speak of that which it is easy to comprehend as the
organ, or the seat of the mind; when we speak of the mind, we
have greater difficulty in comprehending the meaning of the term
we employ; but when we speak of the Soul, we have reached a point
which defies our understanding, because our knowledge is limited.
The brain may be injured by a blow; the mind may be pained by a
disagreeable sight, or offended by a harsh word; but the Soul
can only be influenced secondarily through the mind, which is
primarily affected by the organs of the material senses. Thus the
happiness or the misery of the Soul depends to a very great extent
upon the proper fulfilment of the duties of the senses, which are
the servants of the Soul, over which the mind presides, as the
steward who mediates between the employer and the employed.</p>

<p class="bq">The Ear, which is taught to delight in sweet sounds, and in pure
language, is a better servant of the master Soul, than one which
delights not in music, and which listens, with approbation or
indifference, to the oaths of the profane. The Eye which rejoices
in the beauties of nature, and in scenes of domestic happiness
and love, is a more faithful servant than one that delights in
witnessing scenes of revelry, dissipation, and strife. The Nose
which esteems the sweet odour of flowers, or the life-giving
freshness of the pure air, is more dutiful to his master than one
that rejects not the polluted atmosphere of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
neglected dwellings.
The Mouth which thirsts for morbid gratification of taste, is more
worthless than one which is contented with wholesome viands, and
ruled by the proper instincts of its duty. Who that can understand
the wonderful structure of the tongue, and the complicated
mechanism of the organs of speech and of hearing, could be found
to take pleasure in the utterance of oaths, and of words of vulgar
meaning? Were those beautiful cords that like threads of silk are
woven into the muscular texture of the mouth, and along which
the essence of life travels with the quickness of thought, to do
the bidding of the will&mdash;were they given for no higher use than
to sin against the God who gave them, and upon whose mercy their
existence every moment depends?</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."&mdash;<span class="smcap">James iii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">The actions of the senses must necessarily affect the mind, which
is the head steward of the Soul; and the Soul becomes rich in
goodness, or poor in sin, in proportion as the stewardship, held
by his many servants, is rightly or wrong-fully fulfilled. As in
an establishment where the servants are not properly directed
and ruled, they often gain the ascendancy, and the master has no
power over them, so with man, when he gives himself up to sensual
indulgences. The Soul becomes the slave of the senses&mdash;the master
is controlled by the servants.</p>

<p class="bq">With regard to the mechanism of motion, let us take the case of
a man who is walking a crowded thoroughfare, and we shall see
how active are all the servants of the Soul, under the influence
of the mind. He walks along in a given direction. But for the
act of volition in the mind, not a muscle would stir. The eye
is watching his footsteps. There is a stone in his path, the
eye informs the mind, the mind communicates with the brain, and
the nerves stimulate the muscles of the leg to lift the foot a
little higher, or turn it on one side, and the stone is avoided.
The eye alights on a familiar face, and the mind remembers that
the eye has seen that face before. The man goes on thinking of
the circumstance under which he saw that person, and partially
forgets his walk, and the direction of his steps. But the nerves
of volition and motion unite to keep the muscles up to their work,
and he walks on without having occasion to think continually,
"I must continue walking." He has not to make an effort to lift
his leg along between each interval of meditation; he walks and
meditates the while. Presently a danger approaches him from
behind. The eye sees it not&mdash;knows no more, in fact, than if it
were dead. But the ear sounds the alarm, tells the man, by the
rumbling of a wheel, and the tramp of horses' feet, that he is in
danger; and then the nerves, putting forth their utmost strength,
whip the muscles up to the quick performance of their duty; the
man steps out of the way of danger, and is saved. He draws near
to a sewer, which is vomiting forth its poisonous exhalations.
The eye is again unconscious&mdash;it cannot see the poison lurking in
the air. The ear, too, is helpless; it cannot bear witness to the
presence of that enemy to life. But the nose detects the noxious
agent, and then the eye points out the direction of the sewer, and
guides his footsteps to a path where he may escape the injurious
consequences. A clock strikes, the ear informs him that it is the
hour of an appointment; the nerves stimulate the muscles again,
and he is hastened onward. He does not know the residence of his
friend, but his tongue asks for him, and his ear makes known the
reply. He reaches the spot&mdash;sits&mdash;rests. The action of the muscles
is stayed; the nerves are for a time at rest. The blood which
had flown freely to feed the muscles while they were working,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
goes more steadily through the arteries and veins, and the lungs,
which had been purifying the blood in its course, partake of the
temporary rest.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"I am but a little child: I know not how to go
out or come in."&mdash;<span class="smcap">I Kings iii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Let us remember that there are two sets of muscles, acting in
unison with each other, to produce the various motions; they are
known by the general terms of <i>flexors</i> and <i>extensors</i>;
 the first
enable us to bend the limbs, the other to bring the limbs back to
their former position. The flexors enable us to close the hand,
the extensors to open it again. The flexors enable us to raise the
foot from the ground; the extensors set the foot down again in the
place desired. Consider for a moment the nicety with which the
powers of these muscles must be balanced, and the harmony which
must subsist between them in their various operations. When we
are closing the hand, if the extensor muscles did not gradually
yield to the flexors&mdash;if they gave up their hold all at once, the
hand, instead of closing with gentleness and ease, would be jerked
together in a sudden and most uncomfortable manner. If, in such
a case, you were to lay your hand with its back upon the table,
and wish to close the hand, the fingers would fall down upon the
palm suddenly, like the lid of a box. Again, consider how awkward
it would be in such a case; our walk through the streets would
become a series of jumps and jerks; when a man had raised his
foot, after it had been jerked up, there it would stand fixed for
a second before the opposite muscles could put on their power to
draw it down again. This case is not at all suppositious: there is
a derangement frequently observed in horses, in which one set of
muscles becomes injured, and we may see horses suffering from this
ailment, trotting along with one of their legs jerking up much
higher than the others, and set down again with difficulty, just
in the manner described.</p>

<p class="bq">It is also to be observed that very nice proportions must exist
between the sizes of the muscles and the sizes of the bones. If
this were not the case, our motions, instead of being firm and
steady, would be all shaky and uncertain. In old persons the
muscles become weak and relaxed; hence there is a tendency in the
movements of the aged to fall, as it were, together; the head is
no longer erect, the body bends, the knees totter, and the arms
lean towards the body as for support.</p>

<p class="bq">In the child a somewhat similar state of things exists. The
muscles have not been properly developed, nor have they been
brought sufficiently under the controul of the nervous system. The
child, therefore, totters and tumbles about, and it is not until
it has stumbled and tumbled some hundreds of times in its little
history, that the muscles have become strong enough to fulfil
their office, or have been brought sufficiently under the controul
of the nervous system, to perform well the various duties required
from them.</p>

<p class="bq">In all these things, we recognise the perfection of the divine
works. We are apt, too apt, to overlook this perfection,
because it prevails in everything; but by speculating upon what
inconveniences we might suffer, were not things ordained as they
are, we obtain most convincing evidences of divine goodness and
wisdom.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Watchman, what of the night? The watchman said,
The morning cometh, and also the night; if ye will enquire, enquire
ye; return, come."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah xxi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Having taken this view of the muscular system of the external
man, let us turn our attention to the muscles of the internal
organs. The muscles of which we have been speaking are called
the voluntary muscles, because we have them under our own
controul&mdash;they are subject to the influences of our will. But
there is the other set of muscles. What are they? We talk of the
beating, or of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the palpitation, of the heart. But, what is it
that causes the heart to beat? You cannot, if you wish it, make
your heart beat more quickly or more slowly. Place your finger
upon your pulse, and notice the degree of rapidity with which its
pulsations follow. Now think that you should like to double the
frequency of those pulsations. Say to the heart, with your inner
voice, that you wish it to beat 120 times in a minute, instead of
60. It does not obey you; it does not appreciate your command.
Now place your finger on the table, and your watch by the side of
your hand, and tell your finger to beat 60 times in the minute,
or 100 times, or 150 times, or 200 times, and the finger will
obey you&mdash;because it is <i>moved by muscles which are subject to
the will</i>, while the heart is composed of muscles which are <i>not
subject to the will</i>. Why should this be? Why should man have the
power to regulate his finger, and not to regulate his heart?</p>

<p class="bq">For the sustentation of our bodies it is needful that the blood
should ever be in circulation. If the heart were to cease beating
only for three or four minutes (perhaps less) life would be
extinct. In this short time the whole framework of man, beautiful
in its proportions, perfect in its parts, would pass into the
state of dead matter, and would simply wait the decay that follows
death. The eye would become dull and glazed, the lips would turn
blue, the skin would acquire the coldness of clay&mdash;love, hope,
joy, would all cease. The sweetest, the fondest ties would be
broken. Flowers might bloom, and yield their fragrance, but
they would be neither seen nor smelt; the sun might rise in its
brightest splendour, yet the eye would not be sensitive to its
rays; the rosy-cheeked child might climb the paternal knee; but
there, stiff, cold, without joy, or pain, or emotion of any kind,
unconscious as a block of marble, would sit the man <i>whose heart
for a few moments had ceased to beat</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">How wise, then, and how good of God, that he has not placed
this vital organ under our own care! How sudden would be our
bereavements&mdash;how frequent our deaths, how sleepless our nights,
and how anxious our days, if we had to keep our own hearts at
work, and death the penalty of neglect.</p>

<p class="bq">And yet, before we were born, until we reach life's latest
moment&mdash;through days of toil, and nights of rest&mdash;even in the
moments of our deepest sin against the God who at the time is
sustaining us, our hearts beat on, never stopping, never wearying,
never asking rest.</p>

<p class="bq">This brings us to another reflection. Our arms get weary, our
legs falter from fatigue, the mind itself becomes overtaxed,
and all our senses fall to sleep. The eye sees not, the ear is
deaf to sound, the sentinels that surround the body, the nerves
of touch, are all asleep&mdash;you may place your hand upon the brow
of the sleeping man, and he feels it not. Yet, unseen, unheard,
without perceptible motion, or the slightest jar to mar the rest
of the sleeper, the heart beats on, and on, and on. As his sleep
deepens, the heart slackens its speed, that his rest may be the
more sound. He has slept for eight hours, and the time approaches
for his awakening. But is the heart weary&mdash;that heart which has
toiled through the long and sluggard night? No! The moment the
waking sleeper moves his arm, the heart is aware that a motion has
been made, that effort and exercise are about to begin. The nerves
are all arousing to action; the eyes turn in their sockets, the
head moves upon the neck; the sleeper leaves his couch, and the
legs are once more called upon to bear the weight of the body.
Blood is the food of the eye, the food of the ear, of the foot,
the hand, and every member of the frame. While they labour they
must be fed&mdash;that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the condition of their life, the source of
their strength. The heart, therefore, so far from seeking rest, is
all fresh and vigorous for the labours of the day, and proceeds to
discharge its duty so willingly, that we do not even know of the
movements that are going on within us.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I
myself will awake early."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm lvii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Thus we have seen the difference between the voluntary and the
involuntary muscles, and we have perceived the goodness of our
Creator in not entrusting to our keeping the controul of an organ
so vital to life, as the heart.</p>

<p class="bq">But the heart is not the only organ which thus works unseen and
unfelt. There are the lungs and the muscles of the chest, the
stomach, and other parts occupying the abdomen, together with all
those muscular filaments which enter into the structure of the
coats and valves of the blood-vessels, and which assist to propel
the blood through the system. All these are at work at every
moment of man's life; and yet, so perfect is this complicated
machinery, that we really do not know, except by theory, what is
going on within us.</p>

<p class="bq">During the time that the sleeper has been at rest, the stomach has
been at work digesting the food which was last eaten. Then the
stomach has passed the macerated food into the alimentary canal,
the liver has poured out its secretion, and produced certain
changes in the condition of the dissolved food: and the lacteals,
of which there may be many thousands, perhaps millions, have been
busy sucking up those portions of the food which they knew to be
useful to the system, whilst they have rejected all those useless
and noxious matters upon which the liver, like an officer of
health, had set his mark, as unfitting for the public use. This
busy life has gone on uninterruptedly; every member of that body,
every worker in that wonderful factory, has been unremitting in
his duty, and yet the owner, the master, has been asleep, and
wakes up finding every bodily want supplied!</p>

<p class="bq">Notwithstanding that much has already been said of the wonders
that pertain to the eye, it has not yet been considered as the
seat of <i>tears</i>, those mute but eloquent utterers of the sorrows
of the heart. Beautiful Tear! whether lingering upon the brink
of the eyelid, or darting down the furrows of the care-worn
cheek&mdash;thou art sublime in thy simplicity&mdash;great, because of thy
modesty&mdash;strong, from thy very weakness. Offspring of sorrow! who
will not own thy claim to sympathy? who can resist thy eloquence?
who can deny mercy when thou pleadest?</p>

<p class="bq">Every tear represents some in-dwelling sorrow preying upon the
mind and destroying its peace. The tear comes forth to declare the
inward struggle, and to plead a truce against further strife. How
meet that the eye should be the seat of tears&mdash;where they cannot
occur unobserved, but, blending with the beauty of the eye itself,
must command attention and sympathy!</p>

<p class="bq">Whenever we behold a tear, let our kindliest sympathies awake&mdash;let
it have a sacred claim upon all that we can do to succour and
comfort under affliction. What rivers of tears have flown,
excited by the cruel and perverse ways of man! War has spread its
carnage and desolation, and the eyes of widows and orphans have
been suffused with tears! Intemperance has blighted the homes of
millions, and weeping and wailing have been incessant! A thousand
other evils which we may conquer have given birth to tears enough
to constitute a flood&mdash;a great tide of grief. Suppose we prize
this little philosophy, <i>and each one determine never to excite a
tear in another</i>. Watching the eye as the telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of the mind
within, let us observe it with anxious regard; and whether we are
moved to complaint by the existence of supposed or real wrongs,
let the indication of the coming tear be held as a sacred truce to
unkindly feeling, and our efforts be devoted to the substitution
of smiles for tears!</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">There is only one other matter to which we think it necessary
to allude, before we pass to the concluding section of our
work. It has been said (162), that snow which is <i>white</i>, keeps
the earth warm; that <i>white</i> as a colour is <i>cool</i>, and that
<i>black</i> absorbs <i>heat</i> (230). These assertions may appear to be
contradictory, and, taken in connection with the fact of the
blackness of the skin of negroes in hot climates, may at a first
glance be considered unsatisfactory. They are, however, perfectly
reconcileable, and that too, without the slightest evasion of
the real bearing of the asserted facts. White snow is warm <i>on
account of its texture</i>, which, being woolly, forms a layer of
non-conducting substance over the surface of the earth, and <i>keeps
in its warmth</i>;
 white clothing, worn as a garment consisting
of a thin material, is cool, because <i>the white colour</i> turns
back the rays of the sun that fall upon it. Swansdown, although
white, being a non-conductor, would be warm, because, though it
would reflect the light and heat, it would confine and accumulate
the heat of the body. The black skin of the negro is a <i>living
texture</i>, and is not subject to the same laws that govern dead
matter. The skin of the negro is largely provided with cells
which secrete a fatty matter that acts as a non-conductor of the
<i>external</i> heat, and also a much larger number of perspiratory
glands than exist in the skins of Europeans. The perspiration
cools the blood, and carries off the <i>internal</i> heat, while the
oily matter gives a shining surface to the skin, and reflects
the heat, to which the fatty matter presents itself as a
non-conductor. We see, therefore, that there are two express
provisions for the cooling of the negroes' skin, independent of
the colour. The skin of the Esquimaux who inhabits a cold country
is <i>white</i>, though it might be supposed that a black skin would
best conduce to the warmth of his body. But the Esquimaux has,
underneath his skin, <i>a thick coating of fat</i>, by which the
<i>internal heat</i> of the body is prevented from escaping.</p>

<i>a perfect adaptation to the lives allotted to them</i>.</p>

<p>Because they require a high degree of <i>warmth</i>, on account of the

necessary that their coats should be of the <i>lightest material</i>, so
as not to impair their powers of flight; and feathers combine the

<p><a id="question_1031"></a>1031. <i>Why have ostriches small wings?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1032"></a>1032. <i>Why are ostrich feathers soft and downy?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the feathers are not employed for flight, the <i>strength
of the feather as constructed for flying is unnecessary</i>, and the
feathers therefore consist chiefly of a soft down.</p>

<p><a id="question_1033"></a>1033. <i>Why have water-birds feathers of a close and smooth texture?</i></p>

<p>Because such feathers keep the body of the bird warm and dry, by
repelling the water from their surface. A bird could scarcely move
through the water, with the downy feathers of the ostrich, because of
<i>the amount of water the down would absorb</i>.</p>

<p>Because they live upon worms which they find in the soft mud of

to <i>dig down into the mud after their prey</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1043"></a>1043. <i>Why have woodcocks, snipes, &amp;c., nerves running down to the
extremities of their bills?</i></p>

<p>Because, as they dig for their prey in the soft sand and mud, they
cannot see the worms upon which they live. Nerves are, therefore,
distributed to the very point of their bills (where, in other birds,
nerves are entirely absent) <i>to enable them to prehend their food</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1045"></a>1045. <i>Why has the spoon-bill a long expanded bill, lined internally
with sharp muscular points?</i></p>

<p>Because the bird <i>lives by suction</i>, dipping its broad bill in search
of aquatic worms, mollusks, insects and the roots of weeds. The bill
forms <i>a natural spoon</i>, and the muscular points enable the bird to
<i>filter the mud</i>, and to retain the nourishment which it finds.</p>

<p><a id="question_1046"></a>1046. <i>Why has the spoon-bill long legs?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1047"></a>1047. <i>Why have the parrots, &amp;c., crooked and hard bills?</i></p>

shape of the bill, therefore, enables them to <i>hold the nut or seed
firmly</i>, and the sharp point enables them to <i>split or remove the
husks</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1048"></a>1048. <i>Why can a parrot move its upper as well as its lower bill?</i></p>

<p>Because by that means it is enabled to bring the nut or seed nearer
the fulcrum, or joint of the jaw. It, therefore, acquires greater
power, just as with a pair of nut-crackers we obtain increased power
by <i>setting the nut near to the joint</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1049"></a>1049. <i>Why have animals with long necks large throats?</i></p>

<p>As soon as an egg becomes large and heavy enough to be cumbersome to
the bird, it is removed from the body. A shell, impervious to air,
protects the germ of life within, until from two to twenty eggs have
accumulated, and then, although laid at different intervals, their
incubation commences together, and the young birds are hatched at the

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1054"></a>1054. <i>Why are the fins of fishes proportionately so much smaller
than the wings of birds?</i></p>

<p>Because there is less difference between the <i>specific gravity</i> of
the body of a fish, and the water in which it moves, than between the
body of a bird, and the air on which it flies. The fish, therefore
<i>does not require such an expanded surface to elevate or guide it</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1055"></a>1055. <i>Why have fishes scales?</i></p>

<p>Because scales, while they afford protection to the bodies of fish,
are conveniently adapted to their motions; and as the scales <i>present
no surface to obstruct their passage through the water</i>, as hair or
feathers would do, they evidently form the best covering for the
aquatic animal.</p>

<p><a id="question_1056"></a>1056. <i>Why do fishes float in streams (when they are not swimming)
with their heads towards the stream?</i></p>

<p>Because they <i>breathe</i> by the transmission of water over the surface
of their gills, the water entering at the mouth, and passing over the
gills behind. When, therefore, they lie motionless with their heads
to the stream, they are in <i>that position which naturally assists
their breathing process</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1057"></a>1057. <i>Why have fishes air-bladders?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the density of water varies greatly at different depths,

of <i>the specific gravity of the body of the fish to that of the water
in which it moves</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1058"></a>1058. <i>Why have whales a very large development of oily matter about

<p class="bq">What I have always most admired in the mole is its <i>eyes</i>. This
animal occasionally visiting the surface, and wanting, for its
safety and direction, to be informed when it does so, or when it
approaches it, a perception of light was necessary. I do not know
that the clearness of sight depends at all upon the size of the
organ. What is gained by the largeness or prominence of the globe
of the eye, is width in the field of vision. Such a capacity would
be of no use to an animal which was to seek its food in the dark.
The mole did not want to look about it; nor would a large advanced
eye have been easily defended from the annoyance to which the life
of the animal must constantly expose it. How indeed was the mole,
working its way under ground, to guard its eyes at all? In order
to meet this difficulty, the eyes are made scarcely larger than
the head of a corking-pin; and these minute globules are sunk so
deeply in the skull, and lie so sheltered within the velvet of
its covering, as that any contraction of what may be called the
eyebrows, not only closes up the apertures which lead to the eyes,
but presents a cushion, as it were, to any sharp or protruding
substance which might push against them. This aperture, even in
its ordinary state, is like a pin-hole in a piece of velvet,
scarcely pervious to loose particles of earth.&mdash;<i>Paley.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1077"></a>1077. <i>Why has the elephant a trunk?</i></p>

<p>The trunk of an elephant <i>serves as a substitute for a neck</i>,
enabling the animal to crop the branches of trees, or to raise water
from the stream.</p>

<p><a id="question_1078"></a>1078. <i>Why do the hind legs of elephants bend forward?</i></p>

<p>Because the weight of the animal is so great, that when it lay down
it would <i>rise with great difficulty</i>, if its legs bent outward, as
do the legs of other animals. Being bent <i>under the body</i>, they have
a greater power of pushing directly upward, when the powerful muscles
of the thighs straighten them.</p>

<p class="bq">According to Cuvier, the number of muscles, in an elephant's
trunk, amounts to <i>forty thousand</i>, all of which are under the
will, and it is to these that the proboscis of this animal owes
its flexibility. It can be protruded or contracted at pleasure,
raised up or turned to either side, coiled round on itself or
twined around any object. With this instrument the elephant
collects the herbage on which he feeds and puts it into his mouth;
with this he strips the trees of their branches, or grasps his
enemy and dashes him to the ground. But this admirable organ is
not only adapted for seizing or holding substances of magnitude;
it is also capable of plucking a single leaf, or of picking up a
straw from the floor. The orifices of the canals of the extremity
are encircled by a projecting margin, produced anteriorly into
a finger-like process endowed with a high degree of sensibility
and exceedingly flexible. It is at once a finger for grasping and
a feeler: the division between the two nasal orifices or their
elevated sides serves as a point against which to press; and thus
it can pick up or hold a small coin, a bit of biscuit, or any
trifling thing with the greatest ease.&mdash;<i>Knight's Animal Kingdom.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1079"></a>1079. <i>Why have bats hooked claws in their wings?</i></p>

<p>Because bats are almost destitute of legs and feet; at least those
organs are included in their wings. If they alight upon the ground,
they have great difficulty in again taking to the wing, as they
cannot run or spring to bring their wings in action upon the air.
At the angle of each wing there is placed, therefore, a bony hook,
by which the bat attaches itself to the sides of rocks, caves, and
buildings, laying hold of crevices, joinings, chinks, &amp;c.; and when
it takes its flight, <i>it unhooks itself, and its wings are at once

<p><a id="question_1082"></a>1082. <i>Why has the spider the power of spinning a web?</i></p>

<p>Because, as it lives upon flies, but is <i>deficient of the power of
flying in pursuit of them</i>, it has been endowed with an instinct <i>to
spread a snare to entrap them</i>, and with the most wonderful machinery
to give that instinct effect.</p>

<p class="bq">There are few things better suited to remove the disgust into
which young people are betrayed on the view of some natural
objects, than this of the spider. They will find that the most
despised creature may become a subject of admiration, and be
selected by the naturalist to exhibit the marvellous works of the
creation. The terms given to these insects, lead us to expect
interesting particulars concerning them, since they have been
divided into vagrants, hunters, swimmers, and water spiders,
sedentary, and mason-spiders; thus evincing a variety in their
condition, activity, and mode of life; and we cannot be surprised
to find them varying in the performance of their vital functions
(as, for example, in their mode of breathing), as well as in
their extremities and instruments. Of these instruments the most
striking is the apparatus for spinning and weaving, by which they
not only fabricate webs to entangle their prey, but form cells for
their residence and concealment; sometimes living in the ground,
sometimes under water, yet breathing the atmosphere. Corresponding
with their very singular organisation are their instincts. We are
familiar with the watchfulness and voracity of some spiders, when
their prey is indicated by the vibration of the cords of their
net-work. Others have the eye and disposition of the lynx or
tiger, and after couching in concealment, leap upon their victims.
Some conceal themselves under a silken hood or tube, six eyes only
projecting. Some bore a hole in the earth, and line it as finely
as if it were done with the trowel and mortar, and then hang it
with delicate curtains. A very extraordinary degree of contrivance
is exhibited in the trap-door spider. This door, from which it
derives its name, has a frame and hinge on the mouth of the cell,
and is so provided that the claw of the spider can lay hold of
it, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
whether she enters or goes out, says Mr. Kirby, the door
shuts of itself. But the water-spider has a domicile more curious
still: it is under water, with an opening at the lower part for
her exit and entrance; and although this cell be under water, it
contains air like a diving-bell, so that the spider breathes the
atmosphere. The air is renewed in the cell in a manner not easily
explained. The spider comes to the surface; a bubble of air is
attracted to its body; with this air she descends, and gets under
her cell, when the air is disengaged and rises into the cell; and
thus, though under water, she lives in the air. There must be some
peculiar property of the surface of this creature by which she can
move in the water surrounded with an atmosphere, and live under
the water breathing the air.</p>

<p class="bq">The chief instrument by which the spider performs these wonders is
the spinning apparatus. The matter from which the threads are spun
is the liquid contained in cells; the ducts from these cells open
upon little projecting teats, and the atmosphere has so immediate
an effect upon this liquid, that upon exposure to it the secretion
becomes a tough and strong thread. Twenty-four of these fine
strands form together a thread of the thickness of that of the
silk-worm. We are assured that there are three different sorts of
material thus produced, which are indeed required for the various
purposes to which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
are applied&mdash;as, for example, to mix up
with the earth to form the cells; to line these cells as with fine
cotton; to make light and floating threads by which they may be
conveyed through the air, as well as those meshes which are so
geometrically and correctly formed to entrap their prey.&mdash;<i>Note by

<p><a id="question_1083"></a>1083. <i>Why have many insects a great number of eyes?</i></p>

<p>Because the orb of the eye is fixed; there is therefore placed over
the eye a multiple-lens, which conducts light to the eye from every
direction; so that <i>the insect can see with a fixed eye as readily
as it could have done with a movable one</i>. As many as fourteen
hundred eyes, or inlets of light, have been counted in the head of a
drone-bee. The spider has <i>eight eyes</i>, mounted upon different parts
of the head; two in front, two in the top of the head, and two on
each side.</p>

<p><a id="question_1087"></a>1087. <i>Why have cockles stiff muscular tongues?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1088"></a>1088. <i>Why do oxen, sheep, deer, &amp;c., ruminate?</i></p>

<p>Because they have no front teeth in the upper jaw, the place of which
is occupied by a hardened gum. The first process, therefore, consists
simply of <i>cropping</i> their food, which is passed into the paunch, to
<i>be brought up again and ground by the back teeth</i> when the cropping
process is over.</p>

<p>Because, in a wild state, they are constantly exposed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
attacks of carnivorous beasts, and as the mastication of the large
amount of vegetable food required for their sustenance would take a
considerable time, they are provided with stomachs, by which they are
enabled to fill their paunches quickly, and then, retiring to a place
of safety, they bring their food up again, and chew it at leisure.</p>

by which they can bring up the food at will.</p>

<p><a id="question_1090"></a>1090. <i>Why can they keep the unchewed food in the paunch, from the
"cud" they have chewed for nourishment?</i></p>

<p>Because their stomachs are divided into three chambers: 1, the
<i>paunch,</i> where the unchewed food is stored; 2, the <i>reticulum</i>,
where portions of the food are received from the paunch, and
moistened and rolled into a "cud," to be sent up and chewed; and 3,
the <i>psalterium</i>, which receives the masticated food, and continues
the process of digestion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p class="bq">In quadrupeds the deficiency of teeth is usually <i>compensated</i>
by the faculty of rumination. The sheep, deer, and ox tribe, are
without fore-teeth in the upper jaw. These ruminate. The horse
and ass are furnished with teeth in the upper jaw, and do not
ruminate. In the former class, the grass and hay descend into the
stomachs nearly in the state in which they are cropped from the
pasture, or gathered from the bundle. In the stomach, they are
softened by the gastric juice, which in these animals is unusually
copious. Thus softened and rendered tender, they are returned a
second time to the action of the mouth, where the grinding teeth
complete at their leisure the trituration which is necessary;
but which was before left imperfect. I say, the trituration
which is necessary; for it appears from experiments, that the
gastric fluid of sheep, for example, has no effect in digesting
plants, unless they have been previously masticated; that it only
produces a slight maceration, nearly as common water would do in
a like degree of heat; but that when once vegetables are reduced
to pieces by mastication, the fluid then exerts upon them its
specific operation. Its first effect is to soften them, and to
destroy their natural consistency; it then goes on to dissolve
them, not sparing even the toughest parts, such as the nerves of
the leaves. I think it very probable, that the gratification also
of the animal is renewed and prolonged by this faculty. Sheep,
deer, and oxen, appear to be in a state of enjoyment whilst they
are chewing the cud. It is then, perhaps, that they best relish
their food.&mdash;<i>Paley.</i></p>

</div>


<p><a id="question_1093"></a>1093. <i>Why has the pelican a large pouch under its bill?</i></p>

<p>Because it subsists upon fish, generally of the smaller kind, and
uses its pouch <i>as a net</i> for catching them; the pouch also serves
as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> a <i>paunch,</i> in which the fish are stored, until the bird ceases
from the exertion of fishing, and takes its meal at leisure.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And God created great whales, and every living
creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly,
after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw
that it was good."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Genesis i.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">In their wild state they hover and wheel over the surface of the
water, watching the shoals of fish beneath, and suddenly sweeping
down, bury themselves in the foaming waves; rising immediately
from the water by their own buoyancy, up they soar, the pouch
laden with the fish scooped up during their momentary submersion.
The number of fish the pouch of this species will contain may be
easily imagined when we state that it is so dilatable as to be
capable of containing two gallons of water; yet the bird has the
power of contracting this membranous expansion, by wrinkling it
up under the lower mandible, until it is scarcely to be seen. In
shallow inlets, which the pelicans often frequent, it nets its
prey with great adroitness.</p>

<p class="bq">The pelican chooses remote and solitary islands, isolated rocks in
the sea, the borders of lakes and rivers, as its breeding place.
The nest, placed on the ground, is made of coarse grasses, and
the eggs, which are white, are two or three in number. While the
female is incubating, the male brings fish to her in his pouch,
and the young, when hatched, are assiduously attended by the
parents, who feed them by pressing the pouch against the breast,
so as to transfer the fish from the former into the throats of the
young. This action has doubtless given origin to the old fable
of the pelican feeding its young with blood drawn from its own
breast.&mdash;<i>Knight's Animal Kingdom.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1094"></a>1094. <i>Why do the smaller animals breed more abundantly than the
larger ones?</i></p>

<p>Because the smaller ones are designed to be the food of the larger
ones, and are therefore <i>created in numbers adapted to that end</i>.
An elephant produces but one calf; the whale but one young one; a
butterfly lays six hundred eggs; silk-worms lay from 1,000 to 2,000
eggs; the wasp, 5,000; the ant, 4,000 to 5,000; the queen bee, 5,000
to 6,000, or 40,000 to 50,000 in a season; and a species of white
ant (<i>termes fatalis</i>) produces 86,400 eggs in a day. Birds of
prey seldom produce more than two eggs; the sparrow and duck tribe
frequently sit upon a dozen; in rivers there prevail a thousand
minnows for one pike; and in the sea, a million of herrings for a
single shark; while of the animalcules upon which the whale subsists,
there must exist hundreds of millions for one whale.</p>

<p><a id="question_1095"></a>1095. <i>Why has the whale feathery-like laminæ of whale-bone extending
from its jaws?</i></p>

<p>Because these feathery bones, lying side by side, form a <i>sieve, or
strainer</i>, for the large volumes of water which the whale receives
into its mouth, drawing off therefrom millions of small animals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
which form a jelly-like mass upon which the whale feeds. A whale has
been known to weigh as much as 249 tons, and its blubber yielded
4,000 gallons of oil. How many millions of living creatures must have
gone to make up that enormous mass of animal matter!</p>

<p><a id="question_1096"></a>1096. <i>Why have cats, and various other animals, whiskers?</i></p>

<p>The whiskers of cats, and of the cat tribe, are exceedingly
sensitive, enabling them, when seizing their prey in the dark, to

their roots, with branches of the same nerves that give sensibility

<p><a id="question_1097"></a>1097. <i>Why has the horse a smaller stomach proportionately than other

now so admirably performs.</p>

<p><a id="question_1098"></a>1098. <i>Why has the horse no gall-bladder?</i></p>

operation.</p>

<p><a id="question_1099"></a>1099. <i>Why do certain butterflies lay their eggs upon cabbage leaves?</i></p>

<p>Because the cabbage leaves are <i>the food of the young caterpillars</i>;

she knows by instinct that the leaf will afford food to her future
young; she therefore lays her eggs where her young ones will find

dryness of the air, throws out its web, and finds it <i>more than

<p class="bq">The observation of the changing phenomena which attend the various
states of the weather is a very interesting study, though no
general rules can be laid down that can be relied upon, because
there are modifying circumstances which influence the weather in
various localities and climates. To observe weather indications
accurately, no phenomenon should be taken alone, but several
should be regarded together. The character and the duration of
the weather of the preceding days, the direction of the wind,
the forms of the clouds, the indications of the barometer, the
rise or fall of the thermometer, and the instinctive forewarnings
of birds, beasts, insects, and flowers, should all be taken
into account. Although no direct material advantages attend
such a study, it induces a habit of observation, and develops
the inductive faculty of the mind, which, when applied to more
significant things, may trace important effects to their greater
causes.</p>

that it is exhibited to attract the flying insect. The objectors,
however, offer no explanation of the luminous properties of the
worm. Sir Charles Bell says the preponderance of the argument is
decidedly in favour of the explanation we have given.</p>

<p><a id="question_1129"></a>1129. <i>Why does not the iris of the fish's eye contract</i>?</p>

<p><a id="question_1130"></a>1130. <i>Why is the eye of the eel covered with a transparent horny

under stones, &amp;c., it needed such a covering to <i>defend the eye</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1131"></a>1131. <i>Why is the whale provided with an eye, having remarkably thick
and strong coats?</i></p>

<p>Because, when he is attacked by the sword-fish and the shark, he is
almost helpless against his enemies, as they fix themselves upon his
huge carcase. He therefore dives with them down to a depth where the
pressure of the water is so great that they cannot bear it. The eye
of the whale is expressly organised <i>to bear the immense pressure of
extreme ocean depths</i>, without impairing the sight.</p>

<p><a id="question_1132"></a>1132. <i>Why have fishes no eyelids?</i></p>

<p>Because the water in which they swim keeps their eyes moist. Eyelids

<p><a id="question_1133"></a>1133. <i>Why have fishes the power of giving their eye-balls very
sudden motion?</i></p>

<p>Because, having no eyelids (such organs being unnecessary to keep
their eyes moist), they still need the power of freeing their eyes
from the contact of foreign matters; and this is secured to them by
the power they have of giving the eyeball a very rapid motion, which
causes reaction in the fluid surrounding it, and <i>sweeps the surface</i>.</p>

<p class="bq">This motion may frequently be seen in the eyes of fishes, in
glass globes.</p>

<p><a id="question_1138"></a>1138. <i>Why have oxen, and other quadrupeds a tough ligament called

<p>Because their heads are of considerable weight; and having frequent
occasion to lift them, they are provided with an elastic ligament,
which is fastened at the middle of their backs, while its other
extremity is attached to the head. This enables them to raise their
heads easily; otherwise the effort to do so would be a work of great
labour. To the horse, the pax-wax acts as a natural bearing-rein,
assisting it to hold its head in that position which adds to the

<p>Because their young ones are remarkably <i>small and helpless</i>;
 in

Besides which, the full grown animals have very long hind-legs,
and they progress by a series of extraordinary leaps. It would
consequently be impossible for their helpless young ones to follow
them: God has therefore given to female kangaroos and opossums
curious pockets, <i>formed out of their own skin</i>, in which they place

<p><a id="question_1140"></a>1140. <i>What is the difference between an animal, a plant, and a
mineral?</i></p>

<p>The great naturalist, Linnæus, used to say that animals <i>grow</i>, <i>live</i>,
and <i>feel</i>;
 plants <i>grow</i> and <i>live</i>;
 and minerals <i>grow</i>.</p>

<p>Animals are here defined to enjoy <i>three</i> conditions of existence;
plants <i>two</i> conditions; and minerals <i>one</i> condition.</p>

<p>This definition has, in latter days, been held to be unsatisfactory,
since there <i>are a few plants</i> that are <i>supposed to feel</i>, and <i>a
few animals</i> that are supposed to have even <i>less feeling</i> than the
<i>sensitive plants</i> alluded to.</p>

<p>The concise definition by Linnæus, nevertheless, is true, as far as
regards a <i>vast majority</i> of the bodies constituting the three great
kingdoms of nature. And it may be sufficient to say that</p>

<p><i>Animals</i>&mdash;grow, live, feel, and move.</p>

<p><i>Plants</i>&mdash;grow and live.</p>

<p><i>Minerals</i>&mdash;grow, by the addition of particles of inorganic matter.</p>

<p class="bq">If we now state the few exceptions that are admitted to this
definition, we shall bring the explanation as near to the truth,
as the present state of knowledge will permit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p class="center bq">"And God said, Behold, I have given you every
herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree, yielding seed; to you it
shall be for meat."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Genesis i.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1141"></a>1141. <i>Why is it understood that some plants feel?</i></p>

<p>Because the <i>sensitive plant</i> closes its leaves on being touched;
the <i>Venus's fly trap</i> closes its leaves upon flies that alight upon
them; others <i>close</i> upon the approach of rain, and at sunset, and
<i>open</i> at sunrise, and turn towards the sun during its daily transit.</p>

<p><a id="question_1142"></a>1142. <i>Why is it understood that some plants move?</i></p>

<p>Because certain <i>sea-weeds</i> throw off undeveloped young plants, which
move through the water by the aid of fine <i>cilia</i>, or muscular hairs,
until they find a suitable place upon which to attach themselves.</p>

<p>The roots of plants will penetrate through the ground in the
direction of water, and of favourable soil.</p>

<p><a id="question_1143"></a>1143. <i>Of what elementary substances are plants composed?</i></p>

<p>Of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.</p>

<p><a id="question_1144"></a>1144. <i>Whence do plants derive those substances?</i></p>

<p>From the air, the earth, and water.</p>

<p><a id="question_1145"></a>1145. <i>How do plants obtain carbon?</i></p>

<p>They obtain it chiefly from the air, in the form of <i>carbonic acid
gas</i>. The carbon, of the carbonic acid gas, which is thrown out by
the breath of animals, and by other processes in nature, is <i>absorbed
by the leaves of plants</i>, and the <i>oxygen</i> which had united with the
carbon to form the <i>carbonic acid gas</i>, is again set free for the use
of animals.</p>

<p><a id="question_1146"></a>1146. <i>How do plants obtain oxygen?</i></p>

<p>They obtain it from the <i>atmospheric air</i>. But as they do not
require a large amount of oxygen for their own use, <i>they throw off
the amount which is in excess</i>, after having separated it from the
other elements with which it was combined when taken up by them.
From the humble blade of grass, to the stately tree of the forest,
plants operate to purify the air, and to correct and counteract the
corruption of the air, by the myriads of animals inhabiting the earth.</p>

<p class="bq">It has been generally stated that plants in rooms purify the air
by absorbing carbonic acid <i>by day</i>, and releasing a part of the
oxygen; but that, as the presence of light is necessary to produce
this action, they do not restore oxygen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the air, by night, but,
on the contrary, give off carbonic acid gas. Therefore it has been
stated that plants in rooms by night are unhealthy. Mr. Robert
Hunt, one of the ablest chemists of the present time, makes the
following remarks upon this subject in his "Poetry of Science:"&mdash;</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"The heavens declare the glory of God: and
the firmament showeth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth
speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm xix.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">"The power of decomposing carbonic acid is a vital function which
belongs to the leaves and bark. It has been stated, on the authority
of Leibig, that during the night the plant acts only as a mere bundle
of fibres&mdash;that it allows of the circulation of carbonic acid and
its evaporation, unchanged. In his eagerness to support his chemical
hypothesis of respiration, the able chemist neglected to enquire
if this was absolutely correct. The healthy plant never ceases to
decompose carbonic acid during one moment of its existence; but
during the night, when the excitement of light is removed, and the
plant reposes, its vital powers are at their minimum of action, and
a much less quantity is decomposed than when a stimulating sun, by
the action of its rays, is compelling the exertion of every vital
function."</p>

<p class="bq">In hot, swampy countries, where vegetation is very rapid, and the
soil loaded with decomposing carbonic matter, the plants absorb more
carbonic acid than they require, and they <i>then</i> evolve carbonic acid
gas from their leaves. Hence such climates as the West Indies are
injurious to <i>life</i>, though favourable to <i>vegetation</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1147"></a>1147. <i>How do plants obtain hydrogen?</i></p>

<p>They obtain <i>hydrogen</i> in combination with <i>oxygen</i> in water, and
with <i>nitrogen</i>, in the form of <i>ammonia</i>, as which it exists in
animal manures.</p>

<p><a id="question_1148"></a>1148. <i>How do plants obtain nitrogen?</i></p>

<p>From the <i>atmospheric air</i>, and from the <i>soil</i>, in which it is
combined with other elements.</p>

<p><a id="question_1149"></a>1149. <i>How do plants apply these elements to the formation of their
own structures?</i></p>

<p>When those substances which form the food of plants are absorbed,
either by their leaves or their roots, they are converted, with the
aid of water, into a <i>nutritive sap</i>, which answers the same purposes
in <i>plants</i> as <i>blood</i> does in <i>animals</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1150"></a>1150. <i>How is the nutritive sap applied to the growth and enlargement
of the plant?</i></p>

<p>Every seed contains a small amount of nutrition, sufficient for the
sustentation of the <i>germ of the plant</i>, until those vessels are
formed, by which the nutritive elements can be absorbed and used for
the further development of the living structure.</p>

<p>The earth, penetrated by the sun's rays, warms the sleeping germ,
and quickens it into life. For a short time the germ lives upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the seed, which, moistened and warmed by the soil, yields a kind
of glutinous sap, out of which the first members of the plant are
formed. And then the tender leaf, looking up to the sky, and the
slender rootlet penetrating the soil, begin to draw their sustenance
from the vast stores of nature.</p>

<p><a id="question_1151"></a>1151. <i>Of what do vegetable structures consist?</i></p>

<p>Of <i>membranes</i>, or thin tissues, which, being variously arranged,
form cells, tubes, air passages, &amp;c. Of <i>fibres</i>, which form a
stronger kind of membrane, and which is variously applied to the
production of the organs of the plants. And of <i>organs</i>, formed by
those elementary substances, by which the plants absorb, secrete, and
grow, and fulfil the conditions of their existence.</p>

<p><a id="question_1152"></a>1152. <i>Why are seeds generally enveloped in hard cases?</i></p>

<p>Because the covering of the seed, like the shell of an egg, is
designed <i>to preserve the germ</i> within from the influence of external
agencies, until the time for development has arrived, and the
conditions of germination are fulfilled.</p>

<p><a id="question_1153"></a>1153. <i>Why does a seed throw out a root, before it forms a leaf?</i></p>

<p>Because moisture, which the root absorbs from the earth, is necessary
to enable the germ <i>to use the nutrition which the seed itself
contains</i>, and out of which the leaf must be eliminated. Moisture
forms a kind of gluten, in which the starch of the seed is dissolved,
and converted into sugar, the sugar into carbonaceous sap, and the
sap into cellular tissue and woody fibre, as the leaves present
themselves to the influence of the air and light.</p>

<p><a id="question_1154"></a>1154. <i>Why does a plant grow?</i></p>

<p>Because, as soon as membranes and vessels are organised in the young
germ, the nutritive fluid, formed by its first organs, <i>begins to
move through the fine structures</i>, and from that time the plant
commences to incorporate with its own substance the elements with
which it is surrounded, that are suitable to its development.</p>

<p class="bq">Skeleton leaves, and seed vessels of plants, form exceedingly
interesting objects, and serve to illustrate the wonderful
structure of plants. With patience and care, they may be produced
by any person, and will afford an interesting occupation. The
leaves should be gathered when they are in perfection&mdash;that is,
when some of the earliest leaves begin to fall from the trees.
Select perfect leaves, taking care that they are not broken, or
injured by insects. Lay them in pans of <i>rain water</i>, and expose
them to the air to undergo decomposition. Renew the water from
time to time, taking care not to damage the leaves. They need
not be examined more than once a week, and then only to see that
the water is sufficient to cover them. Give them sufficient time
for their soft parts to become decomposed, then take them out,
and laying them on a white plate with a little water, wash away
carefully, with a camel-hair pencil, the green matter that clings
to the fibres. The chief requirement is <i>patience</i> on the part
of the operator, to allow the leaves and seed vessels sufficient
time to decompose. Some leaves will take a few weeks, and others
a few months, but a large panful may be put to decompose at the
same time, and there will always be some ready for the process
of cleansing. When they are thoroughly cleaned, they should be
bleached, by steeping for a short time in a weak solution of
chloride of lime. They should then be dried, and either pressed
flat, or arranged in bouquets for preservation under glass shades.
The result will amply reward the perseverance of the operator.</p>

<p><a id="question_1160"></a>1160. <i>Why are clayey soils unfavourable to vegetation?</i></p>

<p>Because the soil is <i>too close and adhesive</i> to allow of the free

the expansion of the fibres of the roots.</p>

<p><a id="question_1161"></a>1161. <i>Why are sandy soils unfavourable to vegetation?</i></p>

<p>Because they consist of particles that have <i>too little adhesion

 they do not retain sufficient moisture for the
nourishment of the plants; and they allow too much solar heat to pass
to the roots.</p>

<p><a id="question_1162"></a>1162. <i>Why are chalk soils unfavourable to vegetation?</i></p>

<p>Because they do not absorb the solar rays, <i>and are therefore cold to
the roots of plants</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1163"></a>1163. <i>Why are mixed soils favourable to vegetation?</i></p>

<p>Because they contain the <i>elements of nutrition</i> essential to the
development of the vegetables, and the plants absorb from them those
constituents which are necessary to their growth.</p>

<p><a id="question_1164"></a>1164. <i>Why do farmers sow different crops in rotation?</i></p>

<p>Because every plant takes something from the soil, and gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
something back; but all kinds of plants do not absorb nor restore the
elements in the same proportions. Therefore a succession of crops of
one kind would soon impoverish the soil; but a succession of crops
of different kinds will compensate the soil, in some degree, for the
nourishment withdrawn.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"He watereth the hills from his chambers; the

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1165"></a>1165. <i>Why do farmers manure their lands?</i></p>

<p>Because, as soils vary, and crops impoverish the soils, the farmer
employs manure <i>to restore fertility</i>, and to <i>adapt the soils to the
wants of the plants</i> he desires to cultivate.</p>

<p class="bq">It is remarkable that Nature herself points out to man the
necessity for changing the succession of vegetable growths.</p>

<p class="bq">When plants have exhausted the soil upon which they grow, they
will push their roots far in search of sustenance, and in time
migrate to a new soil, while other plants will spring up and
thrive upon the area vacated. When a forest in North America is
destroyed by fire, the trees that grow afterwards are unlike
those that the fire consumed, and evidently arise from seeds that
have long lain buried in the earth, waiting the time when the
ascendancy of the reigning order of plants should cease.</p>

<p><a id="question_1166"></a>1166. <i>Why are grasses so widely diffused throughout nature?</i></p>

<p>Because they form the <i>food</i> of a very large portion of the animal
kingdom. They have therefore been abundantly provided. No spot of
earth is allowed to remain idle long. When the foot of man ceases to
tread down the path, grass immediately begins to appear; and by its
universality and the hardihood of its nature, it clothes the earth as
with a carpet.</p>

<p class="bq">Many grasses, whose leaves are so dry and withered that the
plants appear dead, revive and renew their existence in the
spring by pushing forth new leaves from the bosom of the former
ones.&mdash;<i>Withering's Botany.</i></p>

<p class="bq">Grasses are Nature's care. With these she clothes the earth;
with these she sustains its inhabitants. Cattle feed upon their
leaves; birds upon their smaller seeds; men upon the larger;
for, few readers need be told that the plants which produce our
bread-corn, belong to this class. In those tribes which are
more generally considered as grasses, their extraordinary means
and powers of preservation and increase, their hardiness, their
almost unconquerable disposition to spread, their faculties of
reviviscence, coincide with the intention of nature concerning
them. They thrive under a treatment by which other plants are
destroyed. The more their leaves are consumed, the more their
roots increase. The more they are trampled upon, the thicker they
grow. Many of the seemingly dry and dead leaves of grasses revive,
and renew their verdure in the spring. In lofty mountains, where
the summer heats are not sufficient to ripen the seeds, grasses
abound which are viviparous, and consequently able to propagate
themselves without seed. It is an observation, likewise, which
has often been made, that herbivorous animals attach themselves
to the leaves of grasses; and, if at liberty in their pastures to
range and choose, leave untouched the straws which support the
flowers.&mdash;<i>Paley.</i></p>

blossom is exactly suited to that of the pea which is formed therein.
The blossom is itself protected by external petals; and when the
wind blows, and threatens to destroy the parts upon which the seeds
depend, the plants <i>turn their backs to the wind</i>, and shelter the
seed.</p>

<p><a id="question_1171"></a>1171. <i>Why are the leaf buds enclosed in scales which fall off as the
leaf opens?</i></p>

<p>Because the scales <i>serve as a shelter</i> to the tender structure of
the young leaf. The scales are rudimentary leaves, formed at the end
of the previous season, and which, being undeveloped then, serve to
guard the young leaves of the future year.</p>

<p class="bq">In trees, especially those which are natives of colder climates,
this point is taken up earlier. Many of these trees (observe
in particular the <i>ash</i> and the <i>horse-chestnut</i>) produce the
embryos of the leaves and flowers in one year, and bring them to
perfection the following. There is a winter therefore to be gotten
over. Now what we are to remark is, how nature has prepared for
the trials and severities of that season. These tender embryos
are, in the first place wrapped up with a compactness, which
no art can imitate; in which state they compose what we call
the bud. This is not all. The bud itself is enclosed in scales;
which scales are formed from the remains of past leaves, and
the rudiments of future ones. Neither is this the whole. In the
coldest climates, a third preservative is added, by the bud
having a <i>coat</i> of gum or resin, which, being congealed, resists
the strongest frosts. On the approach of warm weather this gum
is softened, and ceases to be an hindrance to the expansion of
the leaves and flowers. All this care is part of that system
of provisions which has for its object and consummation, the
production and perfecting of the seeds.&mdash;<i>Paley.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1172"></a>1172. <i>Why are the seeds of many plants enclosed in a rich juice, or
pulp?</i></p>

<p>Because the matter by which the seed is surrounded, as well as being
intended for the <i>nourishment and care of the seed</i>, is designed for
the use of man and of animals, by whom the seed is set free to take
its place in the earth.</p>

<p class="bq">By virtue of this process, so necessary, but so diversified, we
have the seed, at length, in stone-fruits and nuts, incased in
a strong shell, the shell itself enclosed in a pulp or husk, by
which the seed within is, or hath been, fed; or, more generally
(as in grapes, oranges, and the numerous kinds of berries),
plunged overhead in a glutinous syrup, contained within a skin or
bladder; at other times (as in apples and pears) embedded in the
heart of a firm fleshy substance; or (as in strawberries) pricked
into the surface of a soft pulp.</p>

<p class="bq">These and many more varieties exist in what we call <i>fruits</i>.
In pulse, and grain, and grasses; seeds (as in the pea tribe)
regularly disposed in parchment pods, which, though soft and
membranous, completely exclude the wet even in the heaviest
rains; the pod also, not seldom, (as in the bean), lined with
a fine down; at other times (as in the senna) distended like a
blown bladder; or we have the seed enveloped in wool (as in the
cotton-plant), lodged (as in pines) between the hard and compact
scales of a cone, or barricadoed (as in the artichoke and thistle)
with spikes and prickles; in mushrooms, placed under a pent-house;
in ferns, within slits in the back part of the leaf; or (which
is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
most general organisation of all) we find them covered by
strong, close tunicles, and attached to the stem according to an
order appropriated to each plant, as is seen in the several kinds
of grains and of grasses.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And I will send grass in thy fields for thy
cattle, that thou mayest eat, and be full."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Deuteronomy xi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">In which enumeration, what we have first to notice is, unity of
purpose under variety of expedients. Nothing can be more <i>single</i>
than the design; more <i>diversified</i> than the means. Pellicles,
shells, pulps, pods, husks, skin, scales armed with thorns, are
all employed in prosecuting the same intention. Secondly; we may
observe, that in all these cases, the purpose is fulfilled within
a just and <i>limited</i> degree. We can perceive, that if the seeds
of plants were more strongly guarded than they are, their greater
security would interfere with other uses. Many species of animals
would suffer, and many perish, if they could not obtain access
to them. The plant would overrun the soil; or the seed be wasted
for want of room to sow itself. It is, sometimes, as necessary to
destroy particular species of plants, as it is, at other times,
to encourage their growth. Here, as in many cases, a balance is
to be maintained between opposite uses. The provisions for the
presentation of seeds appear to be directed, chiefly against
the inconstancy of the elements, or the sweeping destruction of
inclement seasons. The depredation of animals, and the injuries
of accidental violence, are allowed for in the abundance of the
increase. The result is, that out of the many thousand different
plants which cover the earth, not a single species, perhaps, has
been lost since the creation.</p>

<p class="bq">When nature has perfected her seeds, her next care is to disperse
them. The seed cannot answer its purpose, while it remains
confined in the capsule. After the seeds therefore are ripened,
the pericarpium opens to let them out, and the opening is not
like an accidental bursting, but for the most part, is according
to a certain rule in each plant. What I have always thought very
extraordinary; nuts and shells, which we can hardly crack with
our teeth, divide and make way for the little tender sprout
which proceeds from the kernel. Handling the nut, I could hardly
conceive how the plantule was ever to get out of it. There are
cases, it is said, in which the seed-vessel, by an elastic jerk,
at the moment of its explosion, casts the seeds to a distance.
We all, however, know, that many seeds (those of most composite
flowers, as of the thistle, dandelion, &amp;c.) are endowed with what
are not improperly called <i>wings</i>;
 that is, downy appendages,
by which they are enabled to float in the air, and are carried
oftentimes by the wind to great distances from the plant which
produces them. It is the swelling also of this downy tuft within
the seed-vessel that seems to overcome the resistance of its
coats, and to open a passage for the seed to escape.</p>

<p class="bq">But the <i>constitution</i> of seeds is still more admirable than
either their preservation or their dispersion. In the body of the
seed of every species of plant, or nearly of every one, provision
is made for two grand purposes: first, for the safety of the
<i>germ</i>;
 secondly, for the temporary support of the future plant.
The sprout, as folded up in the seed, is delicate and brittle
beyond any other substance. It cannot be touched without being
broken.</p>

<p class="bq">Yet in beans, peas, grass-seeds, grain, fruits, it is so fenced
on all sides, so shut up and protected, that whilst the seed
itself is rudely handled, tossed into sacks, shovelled into heaps,
the sacred particle, the miniature plant remains unhurt. It is
wonderful, also, how long many kinds of seeds, by the help of
their integuments, and perhaps of their oils, stand out against
decay. A grain of mustard-seed has been known to lie in the earth
for a hundred <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
years; and as soon as it had acquired a favourable
situation, to shoot as vigorously as if just gathered from the
plant. Then, as to the second point, the temporary support of
the future plant, the matter stands thus. In grain, and pulse,
and kernels, and pipins, the germ composes a very small part
of the seed. The rest consists of a nutritious substance, from
which the sprout draws its aliment for some considerable time
after it is put forth; viz., until the fibres, shot out from the
other end of the seed, are able to imbibe juices from the earth,
in a sufficient quantity for its demand. It is owing to this
constitution that we see seeds sprout, and the sprouts make a
considerable progress, without any earth at all.</p>

<p class="bq">From the conformation of fruits alone, one might be led, even
without experience, to suppose, that part of this provision
was destined for the utilities of animals. As limited to the
plant, the provision itself seems to go beyond its object. The
flesh of an apple, the pulp of an orange, the meat of a plum,
the fatness of the olive, appear to be <i>more</i> than sufficient
for the nourishing of the seed or kernel. The event shows, that
this redundancy, if it be one, ministers to the support and
gratification of animal natures; and when we observe a provision
to be more than sufficient for one purpose, yet wanted for another
purpose, it is not unfair to conclude that both purposes were
contemplated together.&mdash;<i>Paley.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1173"></a>1173. <i>Why have climbing plants tough curly tendrils?</i></p>

<p>Because, <i>having no woody stalks of their own</i> to support them, they

<p><a id="question_1177"></a>1177. <i>Why have the berries of the mistletoe a thick viscid juice?</i></p>

<p>Because the mistletoe is a <i>parasitical</i> plant, growing upon the
bark of other trees. It will not grow in the ground; its seeds are
therefore filled with an exceedingly sticky substance, which serves
to attach them to the bark of trees, to which the berries attach
themselves at once, by throwing out tough fibres; and the next year
the plant grows.</p>

<p><a id="question_1179"></a>1179. <i>What is the circulation of the sap in plants?</i></p>

<p>The circulation of the sap is the movement of the nutritive juices
by which the plant is sustained. There is a slow uninterrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
movement of the sap from the root through the stems to the leaves,
and downwards from the leaves through the bark to the root.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1180"></a>1180. <i>Why does the sap of plants thus ascend and descend?</i></p>

<p>Because it <i>conveys upward</i> from the ground some of the matter by
which the plant is to be nourished, and which must undergo digestion
in the leaves; and it <i>brings downward</i> from the leaves the matters
absorbed, for the nourishment of the plant, and discharges through
the root the substances which the plant cannot use.</p>

<p>The movement of the sap is most active in the spring; but in the
depths of the winter it almost ceases.</p>

<p class="bq">There are other motions of the sap in plants, which are called
<i>special</i>, in distinction from the ascending and descending of
the sap, which is called <i>general</i>, or common to all plants. The
special movements of the sap are peculiar to certain plants, in
some of which a fluid, full of little green cells, is found to
have a rotatory motion; in other plants, a milky fluid is found to
move through particular tissues of the vegetable structure.</p>

<p><a id="question_1181"></a>1181. <i>Why are the leaves of plants green?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1182"></a>1182. <i>Why are the hearts of cabbages, lettuces, &amp;c., of a pale
yellow colour?</i></p>

<p>Because the action of <i>light</i> is necessary to the formation of
<i>chlorophyll</i>;
 and as the leaves are folded upon each other, they
exclude the light, and the green matter is not formed.</p>

<p><a id="question_1183"></a>1183. <i>Why do leaves turn brown in the autumn?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1184"></a>1184. <i>Why do succulent fruits, such as gooseberries, plums, &amp;c.,

<p><a id="question_1186"></a>1186. <i>Why do some leaves turn yellow?</i></p>

<p>Because they retain an excess of <i>nitrogen</i>. Leaves undergoing decay
turn either yellow, red, crimson, or violet. Yellow is due to the
excess of <i>nitrogen</i>;
 red and crimson to various proportions of
<i>oxygen</i>;
 violet to a mixture of <i>carbon</i>;
 and green to <i>chlorophyll</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1187"></a>1187. <i>Why do leaves fall off in the autumn?</i></p>

<p>Because they have supplied for a season the natural wants of the

the leaf ceases, and it falls to the ground to decay, and enrich the

preying upon the bodies of vegetable-eaters.</p>

afford rich perfumes to the toilette, and luscious fruits and wines
to the desert; they charm the eye of the child in the daisied field;
they adorn the brow of the bride; they are laid in the coffin with
the dead; and, as the cypress or the willow bend over our graves,
they become the emblems of our grief.</p>

<p><a id="question_1190"></a>1190. <i>What is mahogany?</i></p>

<p>Mahogany is the wood of trees brought chiefly from South America and
Spain. The finest kind is imported from St. Domingo, and an inferior
kind from Honduras.</p>

<p class="bq">We all know the beauty of mahogany wood. But we do not all
know that mahogany was first employed in the repair of some of
Sir Walter Raleigh's ships at Trinidad in 1597. The discovery
of the beauty of its grain for furniture and cabinet work was
accidental. Dr. Gibbons, a physician of eminence, was building
a house in King-street, Covent-garden; his brother, captain of
a West Indiaman, had brought over some planks of mahogany as
ballast, and he thought that the wood might be used up in his
brother's building, but the carpenters found the wood too hard
for their tools, and objected to use it. Mrs. Gibbons shortly
afterwards wanted a small box made, so the doctor called upon his
cabinet-maker, and ordered him to make a box out of some wood
that lay in his garden. The cabinet-maker also complained that
the wood was too hard. But the doctor insisted upon its being
used, as he wished to preserve it as a memento of his brother.
When the box was completed, its fine colour and polish attracted
much attention; and he, therefore, ordered a bureau to be made of
it. This was done, and it presented so fine an appearance that
the cabinet-maker invited numerous persons to see it, before it
was sent home. Among the visitors was her Grace the Duchess of
Buckingham, who immediately begged some of the wood from Mr.
Gibbons, and employed the cabinet-maker to make her a bureau
also. Mahogany from this time became a fashionable wood, and the
cabinet-maker, who at first objected to use it, made a great
success by its introduction.</p>

<p><a id="question_1191"></a>1191. <i>What is rose-wood?</i></p>

<p>Rosewood is the wood of a tree which grows in Brazil. It is,
generally speaking, too dark for large articles of furniture, but is
admirably adapted for smaller ones. It is expensive, and the hardness
of the wood renders the cost of making articles of it very high.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Respecting the other woods used in the manufacture of furniture,
we have nothing special to say, except of the oak&mdash;the emblem of
our native land. This tree yields a most useful and durable wood,
and as it not only defends our country by supplying our "wooden
walls," but gives to us the floors of our houses, furnishes our
good substantial tables, and comfortable arm-chairs, it will be
well for us to know a few facts about this celebrated tree. It is
said that there are no less than one hundred and fifty species
of the oak. The importance of the growth of oaks may be gathered
from the fact, that the building of a 70-gun ship would take forty
acres of timber. The building of a 70-gun ship is estimated to
cost about £70,000. Oak trees attain to the age of 1,000 years.
The oak enlarges its circumference from 10&frac12; inches to 12 inches
in a year. The interior of a great oak at Allonville, in Normandy,
has been converted into a place of worship. An oak at Kiddington,
served as a village prison. A large oak at Salcey, was used as a
cattle fold; and others have served as tanks, tombs, prisons, and
dwelling-houses.</p>

<p class="bq">The <i>Mammoth tree</i>, which is exhibiting at the Crystal Palace,
is one of the great wonders of the vegetable creation. It is the
grand monarch of the Californian forest, inhabiting a solitary
district on the elevated slopes of the Sierra Nevada, at 5,000
feet above the sea-level. From 80 to 90 trees exist, all within
the circuit of a mile, and these varying from 250 to 320 feet in
height, and from 10 to 20 feet in diameter. The bark is from 12 to
15 inches in thickness; the branchlets are somewhat pendent, and
resemble those of cypress or juniper, and it has the cones of a
pine. Of a tree felled in 1853, 21 feet of the bark from the lower
part of the trunk were put in the natural form as a room, which
would contain a piano, with seats for forty persons; and on one
occasion 150 children were admitted. The tree is reputed to have
been above 3,000 years old; that is to say, it must have been a
little plant when Samson was slaying the Philistines. The portion
of the tree exhibiting at the palace is 103 feet in height, and 32
feet in diameter at the base.</p>

<p><a id="question_1192"></a>1192. <i>What is tea?</i></p>

<p>Tea is the leaf of a shrub (<i>Thea Chinensis</i>). The plant usually
grows to the height of from three to six feet, and resembles in
appearance the well-known myrtle. It bears a blossom not unlike that
of the common dog-rose. The climate most congenial to it is that
between the 25th and 33rd degrees of latitude. The growth of good
tea prevails chiefly in China, and is confined to a few provinces.
The <i>green</i> and <i>black</i> teas are mere varieties, depending upon the
culture, time of gathering, mode of drying, &amp;c. <i>Coffee was used in
this country before tea.</i> in 1664, it is recorded, the East India
Company bought 2lb. 2oz. of coffee as a present for the king. In the
year 1832, there were 101,687 licensed tea dealers in the United
Kingdom. Green tea was first used in 1715. A dispute with America
about the duty upon tea led to the American war, out of which arose
American independence. The consumption of tea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> throughout the whole
world is estimated at above 52,000,000 lbs., of which the consumption
of Great Britain alone amounts to 30,000,000. (<i>See</i> <a href="#question_1225">1225</a>).</p>

part of Arabia called Yemen, but it is now extensively cultivated in
India, Java, the West Indies, Brazil, &amp;c. (<i>See</i> <a href="#question_1224">1224</a>).</p>

<p class="bq">The first coffee-house in London was opened in 1652, under the
following circumstances. A Turkey merchant named Edwards, having
brought along with him from the Levant, some bags of coffee, and a
Greek servant who was skilful in making it, his house was thronged
with visitors to see and taste this new beverage. Being desirous
to gratify his friends without putting himself to inconvenience,
he allowed his servant to open a coffee-house, and to sell coffee
publicly.</p>

<p class="bq">Here we have another illustration of the great results springing
from trifling causes. Coffee soon became so extensively used that
taxes were imposed upon it. In 1660 a duty of 4d. a gallon was
imposed upon all coffee made and sold. Before 1732 the duty upon
coffee was 2s. a pound; it was afterwards reduced to 1s. 6d.,
at which it yielded to the revenue, for many years, £10,000 per
annum. The duty has been gradually reduced, and the consumption
has gone on increasing, until at last above 25,000,000 of pounds
are consumed annually! Fancy this great result springing from a
"friendly coffee party" that assembled in the year 1652.</p>

paste is then put into moulds and hardened. The properties are very
healthful, but its consumption is very insignificant, as compared
with tea or coffee. The cocoa tree grows chiefly in the West Indies
and South America.</p>

<p><a id="question_1195"></a>1195. <i>What is cocoa?</i></p>

<p>Cocoa is also a preparation from the seeds or beans of the cocoa
tree. But the best form of cocoa for family use is to obtain the
beans pure, as they are now commonly sold ready for use, and to break
them and then grind them in a large coffee mill.</p>

<p><a id="question_1196"></a>1196. <i>What is chicory?</i></p>

<p>Chicory is the root of the common endive, dried and roasted as
coffee, for which it is used as a substitute. Some persons prefer
the flavour of chicory admixed with coffee. But very opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
opinions prevail respecting the qualities of chicory. We believe
it to be perfectly healthful, and attribute the prejudice that
prevails against it, to its having been used, from its cheapness, to
adulterate coffee.</p>

<p><a id="question_1197"></a>1197. <i>What is sugar?</i></p>

<p>Sugar is a sweet granulated substance, which may be derived from
many vegetable substances, but the chief source of which is the
sugar cane. The other chief sources that supply it are the maple,
beet-root, birch, parsnip, &amp;c. It is extensively used all over the
world. Sugar is supposed to have been known to the ancient Jews. It
was found in the East Indies by Newcheus, Admiral of Alexander, 325
B.C. It was brought into Europe from Asia.</p>

<p class="bq">The art of sugar refining was first practised in England, in 1659,
and sugar was first taxed by name by James II., 1685. Sugar is
derived from the West Indies, Brazil, Surinam, Java, Mauritius,
Bengal, Siam, the Isle de Bourbon, &amp;c. &amp;c. Before the introduction
of sugar to this country, honey was the chief substance employed
in making sweet dishes; and long after the introduction of sugar
it was used only in the houses of the rich. The consumption in
England in 1700 reached only 10,000 tons; in 1834 it had reached
180,000 tons. The English took possession of the West Indies in
1672, and in 1646 began to export sugar. In 1676 it is recorded
that 400 vessels, averaging 150 tons, were employed in the sugar
trade of Barbadoes. Jamaica was discovered by Columbus, and was
occupied by the Spaniards, from whom it was taken by Cromwell, in
1656, and has since continued in our own possession. When it was
conquered there were only three sugar plantations upon it. But
they rapidly increased. Until the abolition of slavery in the West
Indies, the production of sugar was almost exclusively limited to
slave labour. (<i>See</i> <a href="#question_1226">1226</a>).</p>

<p><a id="question_1198"></a>1198. <i>What is wheat?</i></p>

<p>Wheat, rye, barley, oats, millet, and maize, all belong to the
natural order of grain-bearing plants. They all grow in a similar
manner, and all yield starch, gluten, and a certain amount of
phosphates. They are commonly spoken of as <i>farinaceous foods</i>.</p>

<p class="center bq">"I clothed thee also with broidered work, and
shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine
linen, and I covered thee with silk."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezekiel xvi.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">From the Sacred writings we learn that unleavened bread was common
in the days of Abraham. In the earlier periods of our own history,
people had no other method of making bread than by roasting corn,
and beating it in mortars, then wetting it into a kind of coarse
cake. In 1596, rye bread and oatmeal formed a considerable part
of the diet of servants, even in great families. In the time
of Charles the First, barley bread was the chief food of the
people. In many parts of England it was more the custom to make
bread at home than at present. In 1804, there was not a single
public baker in Manchester. In France, when the use of yeast was
first introduced, it was deemed by the faculty of medicine to
be so injurious to health that its use was prohibited under the
severest penalties.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Herault says that, during the siege of Paris
by Henry the Fourth, a famine raged, and bread sold at a crown a
pound. When this was consumed, the dried bones from the charnel
house of the Holy Innocents were exhumed, and a kind of bread
made therefrom. Bread-street, in London, was once a bread market.
From the year 1266, it had been customary to regulate by law the
price of bread in proportion to the price of wheat or flour at
the time. This was called the assize of bread; but, in 1815, it
was abolished. In the year 272 there was a famine in Britain so
severe that people ate the bark of trees; forty thousand persons
perished by famine in England in 310! In the year 450 there was a
famine in Italy so dreadful that people ate their own children.
A famine, commencing in England, Wales, and Scotland, in 954,
lasted four years. A famine in England and France, in 1193, led to
a pestilential fever, which lasted until 1195. In 1315 there was
again a dreadful famine in England, during which people devoured
the flesh of horses, dogs, cats, and vermin! In the year 1775,
16,000 people died of famine in the Cape de Verds. These are only
a few of the remarkable famines that have occurred in the course
of history. Let us thank God that we live in times of abundance,
when improved cultivation, the pursuit of industry, and the
settlement of the laws, render such a calamity as a famine almost
an impossibility.

<p><a id="question_1199"></a>1199. <i>What is cotton?</i></p>

<p>Cotton is a species of vegetable wool, produced by the cotton shrub,
called, botanically, <i>Gossypium herbaceum</i>, of which there are
numerous varieties. It grows naturally in Asia, Africa, and America,
and is cultivated largely for purposes of commerce.</p>

<p class="bq">The precise time when the cotton manufacture was introduced
into England is unknown; but probably it was not before the
17th century. Since then, what wonderful advances have been
made! The cotton trade and manufacture have become a vast source
of British industry, and of commerce between nations. It was
some years ago calculated that the cotton manufacture yielded
to Great Britain one thousand millions sterling. The names of
Hargreaves, Arkwright, Crompton, Cartwright, and others, have
become immortalised by their inventions for the improvement
of the manufacture of cotton fabrics. Little more than half a
century has passed since the British cotton manufactory was in its
infancy&mdash;now it engages many millions of capital&mdash;keeps millions
of work people employed; freights thousands of ships that are ever
crossing and re-crossing the seas; and binds nations together
in ties of mutual interest. The present yearly value of cotton
manufactures in Great Britain is estimated at £34,000,000. About
£6,044,000 of the above sum is distributed yearly among working
people as wages.</p>

<p><a id="question_1200"></a>1200. <i>What is silk?</i></p>

<p>Silk, though not directly a vegetable product, is, nevertheless,
indirectly derived from the vegetable creation, since it is a thread
spun by the silk-worm from matter which the worm derives from the
<i>mulberry leaf</i>.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions
were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand
sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in
Carmel."&mdash;<span class="smcap">I Samuel xxv.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Silk is supplied by various parts of the world, including China,
the East <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Indies, Turkey, &amp;c., where the silk-worm has been found
to thrive. The attempts that have been hitherto made to cultivate
it in this country have proved unsuccessful. At Rome, in the time
of Tiberius, a law passed the senate which, as well as prohibiting
the wearing of massive gold jewels, also forbade the men to debase
themselves by wearing silk. There was a time when silk was of the
same value as gold&mdash;weight for weight&mdash;and it was thought to grow
upon trees. It is recorded that silk mantles were worn by some
noble ladies at a ball at Kenilworth Castle, 1286. It was first
manufactured in England in 1604. In the reign of Elizabeth, the
manufacture of silk in England made rapid strides. In 1666, there
were 40,000 persons engaged in the silk trade. The silk throwsters
of the metropolis were enrolled in a fellowship in 1562, and
were incorporated in 1629. In 1685, a considerable impetus was
given to the English silk manufactures. Louis the Fourteenth
of France revoked the edict of Nantes. The edict of Nantes was
promulgated by Henry the Fourth of France in 1598. It gave to the
Protestants of France the free exercise of their religion. Louis
the Fourteenth revoked this edict in 1685, and thereby drove the
Protestants as refugees to England, Holland, and parts of Germany,
where they established various manufactures. Many of these French
refugees settled in Spitalfields, and there founded extensive
manufactories, which soon rivalled those of their own country;
and thus the intolerance of the king was justly punished. What
important facts we see connected with the simple thread of the
silk-worm!</p>

<p><a id="question_1201"></a>1201. <i>What is wool?</i></p>

<p>Wool is a kind of soft hair or coarse down, produced by various
animals, but chiefly by sheep.</p>

<p class="bq">This is another of the useful productions of nature, for which
we are indirectly indebted to the vegetable kingdom; for were it
not for the rich pastures forming the green carpet of the earth,
it would be impossible for man to keep large flocks of sheep for
the production of wool. Wool, like the hair of most animals,
completes its growth in a year, and then exhibits a tendency to
fall off. For the production of wool in England and Wales it has
been estimated that there are no less than 27,000,000 sheep and
lambs; and, in Great Britain and Ireland, the total number is
estimated at 82,000,000. Wool was not manufactured in any quantity
in England until 1331, when the weaving of it was introduced by
John Kempe and other artizans from Flanders. The exportation or
non-exportation of wool has from time to time formed a vexed
subject for legislators. Woollen clothes were made an article of
commerce in the reign of Julius Cæsar. They were made in England
prior to 1200. Blankets were first made in England in 1340.
The art of dyeing wools was first introduced into England in
1608. The annual value of the raw material in wool is set down
at £6,000,000; the wages of workmen engaged in the wool trade,
£9,600,000. The number of people employed is said to be 500,000.</p>

<p><a id="question_1202"></a>1202. <i>What is starch?</i></p>

<p>Starch is one of the most useful products of the vegetable kingdom.
As a rule, <i>a vegetable, if nutritious at all, is so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> according to
the amount of starch which it contains</i>. It is most abundantly found
in the seeds of plants, and especially in the <i>wheat</i> tribe.</p>

<p>It is also met with in the cellular tissues of plants, and especially
in such underground stems as the <i>potatoe</i>, <i>carrot</i>, <i>turnip</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i>, and the stems of the <i>sago-palm</i> fig, &amp;c. It is also found in
the <i>bark</i> of some trees.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
variableness, neither shadow of turning."&mdash;<span class="smcap">James i.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1203"></a>1203. <i>Why is the horse chestnut, though containing a great quantity
of starch, unfit for food?</i></p>

<p>Because (like many other vegetable productions) it contains with the
starch an <i>acrid juice</i>, which renders it unhealthy; and although the
juice can be separated from the starch, the process is too expensive
to be made generally available.</p>

<p class="bq">The starch which is used for domestic purposes is an artificial
preparation, and does not properly represent the starch of
nutrition. A better idea of it is afforded by <i>the meal of a
flowery potatoe</i>. The starch used by laundresses is frequently
prepared from diseased potatoes. This does not impair the quality
of the starch, for the purposes of the laundress, and the reason
why potatoes that are diseased are thus applied is, that it is
one method of saving some part of their value. The finest kinds
of starch are prepared from rice. It is prepared by breaking the
pulp, and disengaging the starch from the cells; and it is then
put through other processes to remove the fragments of the broken
cells. But in the flowery meal of the potatoe, the starch cell may
be seen entire.</p>

<p><a id="question_1204"></a>1204. <i>What are vegetable oils and fats?</i></p>

<p>Vegetable oils and fats constitute, next to starch and sugar, the
most important secretion of the vegetable creation. There are very
few plants from which some amount of oil cannot be obtained; and
those which are famed for yielding it owe their celebrity rather to
the abundance that they yield, and the peculiar qualities of their
oil, than to the secretion of oil being rare&mdash;for probably there is
no plant without it.</p>

<p>Oil is most commonly found in seeds, as <i>rape-seed</i>, <i>linseed</i>,
&amp;c., but it is found also in leaves, as in the rose, sweet-briar,
peppermint, &amp;c., where its presence may be recognised by the
distinguishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> perfume; and it is also found in the wood of a few
trees, such as the sassafras and the sandal-wood; the bark frequently
yields an oily secretion.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; so doth
the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Proverbs xxvii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">The London and North Western Railway Company alone use about
50,000 gallons of oil yearly.</p>

<p><a id="question_1205"></a>1205. <i>Why are fat and oil found most abundantly in the bodies of
animals in cold climates</i>?</p>

<p>Because they contribute to keep the <i>bodies of animals warm</i>, not
only by their non-conducting property <i>keeping in</i> the heat of
the animals, but by supplying <i>carbon</i> abundantly to combine with
<i>oxygen</i> during respiration, and thereby developing <i>animal heat</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1206"></a>1206. <i>Why are oil and fat-forming trees found most abundantly in hot
climates?</i></p>

<p>Because, in hot countries, the formation of large quantities of fat
in animal bodies would oppress living creatures with heat; fats
and oils are, therefore, produced in those countries chiefly by
vegetables, and are used externally by the Asiatics and Africans as
an <i>external</i> unction for <i>cooling the skin</i>, and as <i>perfumes</i> which
give inspiriting properties to the air, rendered oppressive by excess
of heat.</p>

<p><a id="question_1207"></a>1207. <i>Why are succulent fruits most abundant in tropical climates?</i></p>

<p>Because they are rendered necessary in those climates by the
<i>excessive heat</i>, and are found to have a most beneficial effect
in cooling, purifying the blood of the inhabitants of tropical
countries; while the grandeur of their foliage, and the richness of
their flowers, are in perfect keeping with the intensity of light and
heat, and serve, by throwing dense shades over the earth, to cool its
surface, and to offer to living creatures a pleasant retreat from the
rays of the burning sun.</p>

<p class="bq">The following sketch of <i>Botanical Geography</i> should be read
attentively after the reader has gone through the whole of the
Chapters of "Reasons." The technical terms employed in the course
of the article are nearly all explained at 1212, and should
be committed to memory at the commencement of the perusal.
<i>Mimosa</i> means a sensitive plant; <i>concentric zones</i>, circular
lines spreading from a centre; <i>arborescent</i>, resembling trees;
<i>Gramineæ</i>, grass-like. The botanical names represent individual
plants.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1208"></a>1208. When treating of the geographical distribution of vegetables,
we have to mark the general arrangements indicated, and the agencies
that have evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> operated in promoting the diffusion of floral
tribes. Vegetation occurs over the whole globe, therefore, under the
most opposite conditions. Plants flourish in the bosom of the ocean
as well as on land, under the extremes of cold and heat in polar
and equatorial regions, on the hardest rocks and the soft alluvium
of the plains, amidst the perpetual snow of lofty mountains, and in
springs at the temperature of boiling water, in situations never
penetrated by the solar rays, as the dark vaults of caverns, and the
walls of mines, as well as freely exposed to the influences of light
and air. But these diverse circumstances have different species and
genera. There is only one state which seems fatal to the existence of
vegetable life&mdash;the entire absence of humidity.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1209"></a>1209. By species we understand so many individuals as intimately
resemble each other in appearance and properties, and agree in all
their permanent characters, which are founded in the immutable laws
of creation. An established species may frequently exhibit new
varieties, depending upon local and accidental causes, but these are
imperfectly, or for a limited time, if at all, perpetuated.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1210"></a>1210. A genus comprises one or more species similar to each other,
but essentially differing in formation, nature, and in many
adventitious qualities from other plants. A tribe, family, group, or
order, comprises several genera.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1211"></a>1211. The known number of species in the vegetable kingdom has been
gradually enlarged by the progress of maritime and inland discovery;
but owing to great districts of the globe not having yet been
explored by the botanist, the interior of Africa, and Australia,
with sections of America, Asia, and Oceanica, it is impossible to
state the exact amount. The successive augmentation of the catalogue
appears from the numbers below:</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1212"></a>1212. Vegetable forms are divided into three great classes which
differ materially in their structure:&mdash;1. Cryptogamous plants&mdash;those
which have no flowers, properly so called, mosses, lichens, fungi,
and ferns: as distinguished from those which are phænogamous, or
flower-bearing, to which the two following classes belong. 2.
Endogenous plants, which have stems increasing from within, also
called Monocotyledons, from having only one seed-lobe, as the
numerous grasses, lilies, and the palm family. 3. Exogenous plants,
which have stems growing by additions from without, also called
Dicoteledons, from the seed consisting of two lobes, the most
perfect, beautiful, and numerous class, embracing the forest trees,
and most flowering shrubs and herbs.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1213"></a>1213. The exogens furnish examples of gigantic size, and great
longevity. In South America on the banks of the Atabapo, Humboldt
measured a <i>Bombax caiba</i> more than 120 feet high, and 15 in
diameter; and near Cumana, he found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> the <i>Zamang del Guayra</i>, a
species of mimosa, the pendant branches of the hemispherical head
having a circumference of upwards of 600 feet. The <i>Adansonia</i>, or
baobab of Senegal, though attaining no great height, rarely more
than fifty feet, has a trunk with a diameter sometimes amounting to
34 feet; while the <i>Pinus Lambertiana</i>, growing singly on the plains
west of the Rocky Mountains, has been found 250 feet high, 60 feet
in circumference at the base, 4&frac12; feet in girth at the height of
190 feet, yielding cones 11 inches round, and 16 long. The <i>Ficus
Indicus</i>, or banian tree, sending out shoots from its horizontal
branches, which reaching the ground take root, and form new stems
till a single tree multiplies almost to a forest, has been observed
covering an area of 1700 square yards.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1215"></a>1215. Admitting, with Professor Henslow, that De Candolle overrated
the ages of these trees one-third, they are examples of extraordinary
longevity. Yew trees upwards of 700 years old remain at Fountains
Abbey, Yorkshire, as there is historic evidence of their existence
in the year 1133. But a yew in the churchyard of Darley-in-the-Dale,
Derbyshire, is considered by Mr. Bowman as 2000 years old.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1216"></a>1216. The cryptogamous plants afford the most numerous examples of
wide diffusion. A lichen indigenous in Cornwall, <i>sticta aurata</i>,
is also a native of the West India Islands, Brazil, St Helena, and
the Cape of Good Hope; while 38 lichens and 28 mosses are common to
Great Britain and Australia, though the general vegetation of the two
districts is remarkably discordant. Some species of endogenous plants
are also widely distributed, the <i>Phleum alpinum</i> of Switzerland
occurring without the slightest difference at the Strait of Magellan,
and the quaking grasses of Europe in the interior of Southern Africa.
But only in very few instances are the same species of exogenous
plants met with in regions far apart from each other; and generally
speaking, in passing from one country to another, we encounter a new
flora; for if the same genera occur, the species are not identical,
while in districts widely separated the genera are different.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1217"></a>1217. The cryptogamic plants, mosses, lichens, ferns, and fungi,
are to the whole mass of phænogamic vegetation in the following
proportions in different districts: Equatorial latitudes, 0 deg.
to 10 deg.; on the plains, 1-25th, on the mountains, 1-5th; mean
latitudes, 45 deg. to 52 deg. &frac12;; high latitudes, 67 deg. 70
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
deg., proportion about equal. Thus the proportion of the flowerless
vegetation to the flowering increases from the equator to the poles.
But the family of ferns, <i>filices</i>, viewed singly, forms an exception
to this law, decreasing as we depart from equinoctial countries,
being 1-20th in equatorial and 1-70th in mean latitudes, and not
found at all in the high latitudes of the new world.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1218"></a>1218. In equinoctial and tropical countries, where a sufficient
supply of moisture combines with the influence of light and heat,
vegetation appears in all its magnitude and glory. Its lower orders,
mosses, fungi, and confervæ, are very rare. The ferns are aborescent.
Reeds ascend to the height of a hundred feet, and rigid grasses
rise to forty. The forests are composed of majestic leafy evergreen
trees bearing brilliant blossoms, their colours finely contrasting,
scarcely any two standing together being of the same species.
Enormous creepers climb their trunks; parasitical orchidæ hang in
festoons from branch to branch, and augment the floral decoration
with scarlet, purple, blue, rose, and golden dyes. Of plants used by
man for food, or as luxuries, or for medicinal purposes, occurring in
this region, rice, bananas, dates, cocoa, cacao, bread-fruit, coffee,
tea, sugar, vanilla, Peruvian bark, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and
nutmegs, are either characteristic of it as principally cultivated
within its limits, or entirely confined to them.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1219"></a>1219. Rice (<i>Oryza-sativa</i>), the chief food of, perhaps, a third of
the human race, is cultivated beyond the tropics, but principally
within them, only where there is a plentiful supply of water. It has
never been found wild; its native country is unknown; but probably
southern Asia.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1220"></a>1220. Bananas, or plantains (<i>Musa sapientum et paradisiaca</i>), are
cultivated in intertropical Asia, Africa, and America. The latter
species occur in Syria. The banana is not known in an uncultivated
state. Its produce is enormous, estimated to be on the same space of
ground to that of wheat, as 133 to 1, and to that of potatoes as 44
to 1.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1221"></a>1221. Dates (<i>Ph&oelig;nix dactylifera</i>), and cocoa (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>),
belonging to the family <i>Palmæ</i>. The palms, remarkable for their
elegant forms and importance to man, contribute more than any other
trees to impress upon the vegetation of tropical and equinoctial
countries its peculiar physiognomy. The date palm is a native of
northern Africa, and is so abundant between the Barbary states and
the Sahara, that the district has been named Biledul erid, the land
of dates. As the desert is approached, the only objects that break
the monotony of the landscape are the date palm, and the tent of
the Arab. It accompanies the margin of the mighty desert in all
its sinuosities from the shores of the Atlantic to the confines
of Persia, and is the only vegetable affording subsistence to man
that can grow in such an arid situation. The annual produce of
an individual is from 150 to 260lbs. weight of fruit. The cocoa
palm furnishes annually about a hundred cocoa-nuts. It is spread
throughout the torrid zone; but occurs most abundantly in the islands
of the Indian archipelago. The family of palms is supposed to contain
a thousand species, some of large size, forming extensive forests.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1222"></a>1222. Cacao (<i>Theobrama cacao</i>), from the seeds of which chocolate
is prepared, grows wild in central America, and is also extensively
cultivated in Mexico, Guatemala, and on the coast of Cumana.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1223"></a>1223. Bread-fruit tree (<i>Artocarpus incisa</i>), a native of the South
Sea Islands, and Indian archipelago, grows also in Southern Asia,
and has been introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> into the tropical parts of America; but the
fruit is not equal to the banana as an article of human food.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1224"></a>1224. Coffee (<i>Coffea Arabica</i>). The bush has probably for its native
region the Ethiopian Highlands, from whence it was taken in the
fifteenth century to the Highlands of Yemen, the southern part of the
Arabian peninsula. It has been introduced, and is now extensively
cultivated in British India, Java, Ceylon, the Mauritius, Brazil, and
the West Indies, but the quality is inferior, which makes the climate
of the Mocha coffee district of importance, as peculiarly favourable
to the plant. It grows there on hills described by Niebuhr as being
soaked with rain every day from the beginning of June to the end of
September, which is carefully collected for the purpose of irrigation
during the dry season. Forskhal gives the following temperatures in
the district:</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1225"></a>1225. Tea (<i>Thea Chinensis</i>). The plant is indigenous in China,
Japan, and Upper Assam. In the latter country, it has recently
been found in a wild state, and is in process there of extensive
cultivation. As the plant is hardy, its culture has very lately
been attempted in the South of France, and apparently with complete
success. A similar experiment on the burning plains of Algeria
completely failed, all the plants being killed by the heat,
notwithstanding every precaution. Tea was first introduced into
Europe by the Dutch in 1666. The leaves of the coffee-plant have long
been used as a substitute for tea, by the lower classes in Java and
Sumatra; and recently, Professor Blume, of Leyden, exhibited samples
of tea prepared from coffee-leaves, agreeing entirely in appearance,
odour, and taste, with the genuine Chinese production.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1226"></a>1226. Sugar-cane (<i>Saccharum officinaram</i>), a species of <i>Gramineæ</i>,
occurs to some extent without the tropics, having been cultivated
centuries ago in Europe, as at present scantily in the South of
Spain. But it properly belongs to the torrid zone, and has for its
principal districts, the Southern United States, the West Indies,
Venezuela, Brazil, the Mauritius, British India, China, the Sunda
and Philippine Islands. The plant was found wild in several parts
of America on the discovery of that continent, and occurs in a wild
state on many of the islands of the Pacific.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1227"></a>1227. Vanilla (<i>Vanilla aromatica</i>), the fruit of which forms the
well-known aromatic, grows wild principally in Mexico.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1228"></a>1228. Peruvian bark (<i>Cinchona officinalis</i>), a forest tree, of
which there are several species, furnishing the valuable medicine
so called. It is exclusively confined to South America, and grows
chiefly on the Andes of Loxa and Venezuela.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1229"></a>1229. Pepper (<i>Piper nigrum</i>) belongs exclusively to the Malabar
coast, where it has been found wild, Sumatra, which produces the
greatest quantity, Borneo, the Malay peninsula, and Siam. Other
species of <i>Piperace&oelig;</i> occur in tropical America.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1230"></a>1230. Cinnamon (<i>Laurus Cinnamomum</i>), a small tree yielding the
aromatic bark, is found native only in the island of Ceylon; but
another species occurs in Cochin China.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1231"></a>1231. Clove (<i>Myrtus caryophyllus</i>), an evergreen small tree, the
dried flower-buds of which form the celebrated aromatic, grows
naturally in the Moluccas, whence it has been conveyed to other
tropical districts. The island of Amboyna, one of that group, is the
principal seat of its cultivation. The lowest temperature there is 72
degs.; the mean temperature of the year 82 degs.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1232"></a>1232. Nutmeg (<i>Myrstica moschata</i>) grows naturally in several islands
of the eastern archipelago, but is principally cultivated in the
Banda Isles.</p>

<p class="bq">Tropical families and forms successively vanish with an increase of
distance from the equator, and new phases of vegetation mark the
transition from hot to temperate climates. Vividly green meadows,
abounding with tender herbs, replace the tall rigid grasses which
form the impenetrable jungle; and instead of forests composed of
towering evergreen trees, woods of the deciduous class appear, which
cast their leaves in winter, and hybernate in the colder season, the
oak, ash, elm, maple, beech, lime, alder, birch, and sycamore. The
cultivation of the vine becomes characteristic, with the perfection
of the cereal grasses, and a larger proportion of herbaceous annuals
and cryptogamic plants.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1233"></a>1233. The vine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is less impatient of a cold winter
than a cool summer. Hence its northern limit, which coincides with
lat. 47 deg. 30 min. on the west coast of France, rises in the
interior, where, though the winters are colder, the summers are
warmer, to lat. 49 degs., cuts the Rhine at Coblentz in lat. 50 deg.
20 min., and ascends to 52 deg. 31 min. in Germany.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1234"></a>1234. Receding further from the equator, magnificent forests of the
fir and pine tribe prevail, as in the central parts of Russia, on the
southern shores of the Baltic, in Scandinavia, and North America.
But some of the cereals are no longer cultivatable, and several
timber-trees common to the temperate zone do not reach its northern
limits. Gradually all ligneous vegetation disappears entirely as
higher latitudes are approached, the woods having first dwindled to
mere dwarfs in struggling with the elements, hostile to that state
which nature destined them to assume. The limit of the forests is
a sinuous line running along the extreme north of the old world;
and extending from Hudson's Bay, lat. 60 deg., to the Mackenzie
River, lat. 68 deg., and thence to Behring's Strait. The dwarf birch
(<i>Betula nana</i>), a mere bush, is the last tree found on drawing near
the eternal snow of the pole. At the island of Hammerfest, lat. 70
deg. 40 min., near the North Cape, it rises to about the height of a
man, in sheltered hollows between the mountains, its lower branches
trailing on the ground, affording a shelter to the ptarmigan. In
the polar zone, some low flowering annuals, saxifrages, ranunculi,
gentians, chickweeds, and others, flourish during the brief ardent
summer; a few perennials also accommodate themselves to the rigorous
climate by spreading laterally, never rising higher than four or five
inches from the ground; till finally no development of vegetable life
is met with, but lichens, and the microscopic forms that colour the
snow.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1235"></a>1235. In Europe, wheat ceases with a line connecting Inverness in
Scotland, lat. 58 deg., Drontheim in Norway, lat. 64 deg., and
Petersburgh in Russia lat. 60 deg. 15 min. Oats reach a somewhat
higher latitude. Barley and rye ascend to lat. 70 deg., but require a
favourable aspect and season to produce a crop.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1236"></a>1236. The northern limit of the growth of oak, lat. 61 deg., falls
short of that of wheat. The oak makes a singular leap at the confines
of Europe and Asia, disappearing towards the Ural mountains. This is
the case also with the wild-nut and apple. The oak and the wild-nut,
however, re-appear suddenly in Eastern Asia, on the banks of the
Argoun and the Amour; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>apple occurs again in the Aleutian
Isles.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1238"></a>1238. Thus distinct vegetable regions are observed on passing from
south to north through different climatic zones, defined as to
their limits by the isothermal curves, and not by the parallels
of latitude. Similar changes of vegetation mark a perpendicular
transit through varying climates. A succession of plants appear on
the tropical mountains which rise above the snow line, corresponding
to those which are encountered in mean and high latitudes. The
higher we ascend, the more does the number of the phænogamic class
diminish in proportion to the cryptogamic, till only members of the
latter family are found, whose further progress upward is arrested
by the everlasting snow. The last lichen met with by Saussure on
Mont Blanc, <i>Silene acaulis</i>, was also observed by M. Brevais in
the neighbourhood of Bosekop, lat. 69 deg. 58 min. where it was
vegetating on the seashore, shaded by the last pines of Europe.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1239"></a>1239. Isolated mountains display to the best advantage the effort of
climatic change of vegetation.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1240"></a>1240. Etna is divided into three great regions: <i>La Regione Culta</i>,
or fertile region; <i>La Regione Sylvosa</i>, or woody region; <i>La Regione
Deserta</i>, the bare or desert region. But each of these is susceptible
of sub-divisions, defined by the presence of certain families of
plants, forming seven botanical zones.</p>

<p class="bq">1. The sub-tropical zone, which does not rise more than 100 feet
above the level of the sea, is characterised by the palm, banana,
Indian fig, sugar-cane, varieties of mimosa and acacia, which with us
are only found in conservatories.</p>

<p class="bq">2. The hilly zone, rises about 2,000 feet, characterised by the
orange, lemon, shaddock, maize, cotton, and grape plants.</p>

<p class="bq">3. The woody zone lies between the height of 2,000 and 4,000 feet,
where the cork-tree flourishes, several kinds of oak, the maple, and
enormous chestnuts.</p>

<p class="bq">4. The zone between the height of 4,000 and 6,000 feet is
distinguished by the beech, Scotch fir, birch, and, among small
plants, by clover, sandwort, chickweed, dock, and plantain.</p>

<p class="bq">5. The sub-alpine zone, between the elevation of 6,000 and 7,500
feet, produces the barberry, soap-wort, toad-flax, and juniper.</p>

<p class="bq">6. The zone between 7,500 and 9,000 feet, has almost all the plants
of the preceding, with the fleshy and jagged groundsel.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1241"></a>1241. The Peak of Teneriffe exhibits five botanical districts, thus
distinguished by Von Buch:</p>

<p class="bq">1. The region of Africa forms, 0&mdash;1,248 feet, comprising palms,
bananas, the sugar-cane, various species of arborescent <i>Euphorbiæ</i>,
<i>Mesembryanthema</i>, the <i>Dracæna</i>, and other plants, whose naked
and tortuous trunks, succulent leaves, and bluish-green tints, are
distinctive of the vegetation of Africa.</p>

<p class="bq">2. Region of Vines and Cereals, 1,248&mdash;2,748 feet, comprising also
the olive, and the fruit-trees of Europe.</p>

<p class="bq">3. Region of Laurels, 2,748&mdash;4,350 feet, including lauri of four
species, the wild olive, an oak, the iron-tree, the arbutus, and
other evergreens. The ivy of the Canaries and various twining shrubs
cover the trunks of the trees, and numerous species of fern occur,
with beautiful flowering plants.</p>

<p class="bq">4. Region of the Pines, 4,350&mdash;6,270, characterised by a vast forest
of trees resembling the Scotch fir, intermixed with juniper.</p>

<p class="bq">5. Region of the Retama, 6,270&mdash;11,061 feet, a species of broom,
which forms oases in the midst of a desert of ashes, ornamented with
fragrant flowers, and furnishing food to the goats, which run wild
on the Peak. A few gramineous and cryptogamic plants are observed
higher, but the summit is entirely destitute of vegetation.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1242"></a>1242. There are many plants which can accommodate themselves to the
most diverse climates and localities; and therefore ascend from
the plains close to the boundary of vegetable life on the highest
mountains. But it is the general law in these cases for such plants
to be singularly modified in appearance and anatomical structure as
they ascend. The spring gentian, <i>Gentiana verna</i>, is one of the
exceptions, which Raymond found unaltered at all heights in the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1243"></a>1243. Trees, plants, and bushes, of humbler growth, which occur
on the plains and at great heights, are usually much smaller in
the latter situation. The leaves, and everything green about them,
dwindle with the increased elevation; and the pure, well defined
green is exchanged for an ill-defined light yellow. Singular enough,
those parts which seem most capable of resisting cold, as the leaves
and stalks, are uniformly subjected to a diminution of their vital
functions; while the flowers remain of the same size, are never
deformed, and become more dense and richer in their colours. While
the <i>Myosotis silvestris</i> becomes stunted, its flowers assume an
intense blue&mdash;the admiration of the traveller. The flowers of the
pale primrose have a much deeper colour on the top of the Faulhorn,
while the plant itself is much smaller than its congener on the Swiss
plains. The observations of M. Parrot, among others, are to this
effect on the flora of the Caucasus, of Ararat, the Swiss and Italian
Alps, and the Pyrenees. The arctic flora is similarly distinguished.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1244"></a>1244. The preceding references to different climatic states are,
however, perfectly inadequate to explain the phenomena of vegetable
distribution. While an analogy is often observable between the plants
of different regions under corresponding circumstances of latitude,
elevation, and soil, the species are generally found to be different;
and usually the botanical character of countries not widely apart
from each other, is totally different, though un

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1245"></a>1245. Some plants are entirely confined to one side of our planet.
The beautiful genus <i>Erica</i>, or heath, of which there are upwards
of 300 species, occurs with breaks over a narrow surface, extending
from a high northern latitude to the Cape of Good Hope. But the whole
continent of America does not contain a single native specimen; nor
has a <i>P&oelig;nia</i> been found in it, except a solitary one to the west of
the Rocky Mountains. On the other hand, the New World contains many
families, as the <i>Cacti</i>, which are not found naturally in the Old.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1246"></a>1246. Some plants occur in a single specific locality, frequently a
contracted area, and nowhere else. The beautiful <i>Disa grandiflora</i>
is limited to a spot on the top of the Table Mountain at the Cape;
and the celebrated cedar of Lebanon appears to be restricted in its
spontaneous growth to the Syrian mountains. The small island of St.
Helena has an indigenous flora, with a few exceptions different from
that of the rest of the globe.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1247"></a>1247. Mountain chains of no great width very commonly divide a
totally distinct botany. There is a marked difference in the
vegetation of the Chilian and opposite side of the Andes, though the
climate as well as the soil is nearly the same, and the difference of
longitude very trifling. In North America, two completely different
classes of vegetation appear on the two sides of the Rocky Mountains.
A variety of oaks, palms, magnolias, azaleas, and magnificent
rhododendrons occur on the eastern side, all of which are unknown on
the western, the region of the giant pine.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1248"></a>1248. The distinct vegetation possessed by various parts of
the globe, has led to its division into botanical kingdoms or
phyto-geographical regions, named in general after the genera that
are either peculiar to them, or predominant in them. The arrangement
of M. Schouw, which is usually adopted, discriminates twenty-five
great provinces of characteristic vegetation upon the surface of the
earth.</p>

<p class="bq">In constituting any portion of the globe into a phyto-geographical
region, M. Schouw has proceeded upon the following principles:&mdash;1.
That at least one-half of the species should be indigenous in it. 2.
That a-quarter of the genera should also be peculiar to it, or at
least should have a decided maximum. 3. That individual families of
plants should either be exclusively confined to the region, or have
their maxima there.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1249"></a>1249. The phenomena of botanical geography, and the facts of geology,
are mutually illustrative. The existing dry land having been upheaved
above the waters at different epochs, it may be reasonably inferred
that each portion on its emergence received a vegetable creation in
harmony with its position. The ultimate constitution of the general
surface into different botanical kingdoms would hence follow, each of
which has preserved its primitive features, while adjoining, and even
far distant foci, have to some extent intermingled their respective
products, under control of the natural agencies of diffusion.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1250"></a>1250. The agents that involuntarily officiate in the diffusion of
vegetable products are the atmosphere, the waters, and many animals.</p>

<p class="bq">1. The impulsion of the atmosphere in its calmest state, is quite
sufficient to transport to considerable distances seeds furnished
with downy appendages or winglets, as is the case with many plants,
with the minute sporules of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> cryptogamia, which are light as the
finest powder. When ordinary breezes convey the sand-dust of the
Sahara a thousand miles or more from the desert, it may be conceived
that seeds, which are comparatively heavy, are borne far from home
by the hurricane. Two Jamaica lichens, which had never been seen in
France before, were found by De Candolle growing on the coast of
Brittany, the offspring of sporules which had been swept over the
Atlantic.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">2. The mountain torrent washes down into the valley the seeds that
have accidentally fallen into it, or have been swept away by its
overflows; and hence the plants of the High Alps occur on the plains
of Switzerland, which are entirely wanting in France and Germany.
Rivers answer the same purpose more extensively, and also the oceanic
currents. The nicker-tree, one of the leguminous tribe, has been
raised from seed borne across the Atlantic by the Gulf stream.</p>

<p class="bq">3. Animals of the sheep and goat kinds, with the horse, deer,
buffalo, and others, widely disperse several species of plants, the
seeds of which, furnished with an apparatus of barbs and hooks,
adhere to their coating. Seeds also of various kinds pass through the
digestive organs of birds, uninjured as to their vitality. The little
squirrel buries the acorn in the ground for winter provender, and
sows an oak, if prevented from returning to the spot.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1251"></a>1251. Plants capable of extended naturalisation, and serviceable
as articles of food or luxury, have been widely disseminated by
the human race in their migrations. The cerealia afford a striking
example. These important grasses known to the ancients, wheat,
barley, oats, and rye, were the gifts of the Old World to the New.
They are also importations into Europe; but the loose reports of the
ancients, and the diligent researches of the moderns, alike leave
us in ignorance of their native seat. Probability points to the
conclusion that they have spread from the neighbourhood of the great
rivers of Western Asia, the primitive location of the human family;
and it is not impossible that in that imperfectly explored district,
or further east on the Tartarian table-land, some of the cereals may
yet be found growing spontaneously. The first wheat sown in North
America, consisted of a few grains accidentally found by a negro
slave of Cortes, among the rice taken for the support of his army. In
South America the first wheat was brought to Lima by one of the early
colonists, a Spanish lady, Maria d'Escobar. An ecclesiastic, Jose
Rixi, was the first to sow it in the neighbourhood of Quito.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1252"></a>1252. Maize, or Indian corn (<i>Zea mays</i>), has been dispersed in
the Old World from the New; and also a more important product, the
potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>), the use of which now extends from the
extremity of Africa to Lapland. In Chili, the native country of the
plant, it occurs at present in a wild state. The Spaniards imported
it into Spain, and from thence it was communicated to Italy. It was
first made known in England at a subsequent period from Virginia,
having been received there from the Spanish colonists in South
America, as it is not a native of intervening Mexico.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1253"></a>1253. The grape-vine, so extensively spread over Europe, is probably
not indigenous in any part of it. It chiefly owes its diffusion
there to the Romans, who received it from the Greeks, to whom it
most likely immediately came from the country between the Black
and Caspian Seas. The Romans introduced most of the finer European
fruit-trees, some from Africa, as the pomegranate, but the great
majority from Western Asia, as the or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>ange, fig, cherry, peach,
apricot, apple, and pear. A variety of the plum, the damson, or
damascene, came from the neighbourhood of Damascus during the
Crusades. The name of the damask-rose points to the importation of
the plant from the same quarter into Europe.</p>

<p><a id="question_1254"></a>1254. <i>What are vegetable gums?</i></p>

<p>Vegetable gums are secretions of plants which are generally <i>soluble
in water</i>, and which subserve various useful purposes. <i>Gum Arabic</i>
is one of the most important of this class of vegetable productions.</p>

<p><i>Gutta-percha</i> is an invaluable substance lately added to the list of
known vegetable productions. It is obtained by cutting the bark of
trees of the class called <i>Sapotacea</i>. Its proper name is gutta Pulo
Percha, gutta meaning gum, and Pulo Percha is the island whence it is
obtained. But gutta-percha is not, strictly speaking, a gum.</p>

<p><i>India-rubber</i> is also a vegetable secretion, improperly called
elastic gum. It is obtained from the milky juice of various trees and
plants, especially from the syringe tree, of Cayenne.</p>

<p><a id="question_1255"></a>1255. <i>What are vegetable resins?</i></p>

being soluble in spirits.</p>

<p>When one of these substances is soluble in either water or spirits it

<p><a id="question_1260"></a>1260. <i>What is silica?</i></p>

<p>Silica is a mineral substance, commonly known as <i>flint</i>;
 and it is
one of the wonders of the vegetable tribes, that, although flint is
so indestructible that the strongest chemical aid is required for its
solution, plants possess the power of <i>dissolving and secreting</i> it.
Even so delicate a structure as the wheat straw dissolves silica, and
every stalk of wheat is covered with a perfect, but inconceivably
thin coating of this substance.</p>

<p class="bq">Amid all the wonders of nature which we have had occasion to
explain, there is none more startling than that which reveals
to our knowledge the fact that a flint stone consists of the
mineralised bodies of animals, just as coal consists of masses
of mineralised vegetable matter. The animals are believed to
have been infusorial animalculæ, coated with silicous shells,
as the wheat straw of to-day is clothed with a glassy covering
of silica. The skeletons of animalculæ which compose flint may
be brought under microscopic examination. Geologists have some
difficulty in determining their opinions respecting the relation
which these animalculæ bear to the flint stones in which they are
found. Whether the animalculæ, in dense masses, form the flint;
or whether the flint merely supplies a sepulchre to the countless
millions of creatures that, ages ago, enjoyed each a separate
and conscious existence, is a problem that may never be solved.
And what a problem! The buried plant being disentombed, after
having lain for ages in the bowels of the earth, gives us light
and warmth; and the animalcule, after a sleep of ages, dissolves
into the sap of a plant, and wraps the coat it wore, probably "in
the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, and
when the earth first brought forth living creatures," around the
slender stalk of waving corn!</p>

<p><a id="question_1261"></a>1261. <i>Why is silica diffused over the stems of wheat, grasses,

<p>Because, as well as the <i>carbon, and the salts</i>, which form the straw

<p><a id="question_1264"></a>1264. <i>Why is straw frequently used as a manure?</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1265"></a>1265. <i>Why is the structure of herbaceous plants less consolidated

 they, therefore, do not require the enduring qualities of
plants that have to sustain the influences of the elements for a
succession of seasons.</p>

<p><a id="question_1266"></a>1266. <i>Why are the stalks of plants of light structure generally
cylindrical?</i></p>

<p>Because the cylindrical form is stronger than any other; <i>a hollow
cylinder</i>, with moderately thick walls, <i>is stronger than a solid
rod</i>, containing the same amount of material.</p>

<p><a id="question_1267"></a>1267. <i>Why do the stalks of plants become hollow?</i></p>

<p>Because the parallel and perpendicular fibres of the stalk are
developed <i>more rapidly than the horizontal</i>. The growth of the
plant, therefore, consists of a kind of <i>divergence from the centre</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1268"></a>1268. <i>Why are the stomata, or pores of leaves, generally placed on
their under surface?</i></p>

<p>Because, being placed on the under surface, they are <i>shaded</i> from
the action of the <i>sun's rays</i>, and so carry on the function of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>

are also protected from the injurious <i>effects of dust</i>;
 and are

<p><a id="question_1269"></a>1269. <i>Why have plants a formation of pith in their centre?</i></p>

<p>The pith is the chief organ of nutriment, especially in the young
plant. It is the structure which first conveys fluids to, and
receives them from, the newly-formed leaf. It communicates with every
branch, leaf, bud, and flower; and also with the bark, through the
<i>medullary rays</i>, which radiate horizontally from the centre of the
plant. It is the centre of the movements of the sap which occur in
the horizontal vessels; and it holds an important influence over the
life of the plant.</p>

<p><a id="question_1270"></a>1270. <i>Why are trees covered with bark?</i></p>

<p>Because the bark serves to protect the woody structure, and also to
give a passage to the descending sap which flows abundantly in the
spring, and out of which the woody fibre is formed. It is also, from
its peculiar nature, well fitted to endure the changes of the seasons
for many years; and from its non-conducting properties it serves to
maintain the equal temperature of the vital parts of the tree.</p>

<p><a id="question_1271"></a>1271. <i>What is cork?</i></p>

<p>Cork is the bark of a description of <i>oak-tree</i>, which grows in great
abundance in Spain, Italy, and France.</p>

<p><a id="question_1272"></a>1272. <i>Why does the cork-tree release its own bark?</i></p>

<p>Because it possesses a bark which is exceedingly <i>useful to man</i>;

and it seems, therefore, to have been the design of providence that
the tree should cast it off, to be applied to the wants of the human
family; for the cork-tree does not discharge its bark by the mere
cracking, or exfoliation, of its substance; the tree retains the bark
for a number of years, until it has attained that consistency and
thickness which renders it useful, and then the tree forms within the
bark a series of tabular cells, which <i>cut off the connection of the
bark with the internal structure</i>, after which it peels off in large
sheets.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p>Man assists this evident intention of nature, by slitting the bark
from the top of the tree to its base; but even were this not done,
the bark would be cast off by the tree itself.</p>

<p>Another proof of design in this useful adaptation of the cork-tree is
to be found in the fact, that it thrives under treatment that would
destroy other trees. The cork-tree will endure the barking process
for <i>seven or eight successive years</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1273"></a>1273. <i>Why are there curious markings in walnut, mahogany, rose-wood,
satin-wood, &amp;c.?</i></p>

<p>Because those markings are produced by the various <i>structure of the
vessels</i> by which the wood is formed; and by successive zones of
wood, which indicate the periods of growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p><p class="bq">The inclosure of zone within zone is owing to the mode in which
the wood is produced, and the position in which it is deposited.
Wood is formed by the leaves during the growing season, and
passes down towards the root between the bark and the wood of the
previous year (if any), or in the position in which cambium is
effused; and, as the leaves more or less surround the whole stem,
the new layer at length completes a zone, and perfectly encloses
the wood of all former years. This is the explanation of the term
<i>exogenous</i>, which is derived from two words signifying to grow
outwardly, for the stem increases in thickness by successive
layers on the outer side of the previously-formed wood. That this
is the mode of growth has been abundantly proved by experiment,
and demonstrated by accidental discoveries. Thus, if a plate of
metal be inserted between the bark and wood, it will, in progress
of time, become inclosed by the new wood which has overlaid them.
So in like manner if letters be cut deeply through the bark and
into the wood, the spaces will not be filled up from the bottom,
but may be seen in subsequent years overlaid by new wood. A
statement appeared in a daily paper, during the past year, to
the effect that in cutting down a tree a cat had been discovered
inclosed in the wood of the trunk. These facts prove that the wood
is applied from without. Again, if a branch be stripped of its
leaves down to a certain point, it will not grow above that point;
and so, in like manner, if branches be stripped from one side of
a tree, the tree will not grow on that side. If a circle of bark
be removed from a branch above and also below a leaf, it will be
found that increase of size will occur below, but not above that
bud; and so, likewise, whenever a ring of bark is removed from a
tree, the new woody fibre will not proceed from the lower but from
the upper edge.&mdash;<i>Orr's Circle of the Sciences.</i></p>

<p><a id="question_1274"></a>1274. <i>Why have trees with large trunks a great number of leafy
branches?</i></p>

<p>Because it is <i>by the leaves</i> that the secretion is formed which
supplies the <i>woody fibre</i>. The number of leaves on a tree,
therefore, generally bears a relation to the size of its trunk, and
the number of its branches.</p>

<p><a id="question_1275"></a>1275. <i>Why have poplar-trees comparatively few branches and leaves?</i></p>

<p>Because their trunks are comparatively <i>small</i>, although they grow to
a great height.</p>

<p><a id="question_1276"></a>1276. <i>Why had the mammoth-tree comparatively few leaves in relation
to the immense size of its bark?</i></p>

<p>Because the woody texture of this tree (<i>Wellingtonea gigantea</i>) is
<i>exceedingly light and porous</i>. It is, in fact, lighter than cork,
and, therefore, requires less leaf-produce in its formation.</p>

<p><a id="question_1277"></a>1277. <i>Why have oak-trees an abundance of leaves?</i></p>

<p>Because their wood is <i>so dense</i> that they require a larger amount of
the wood-forming secretion which is supplied by the leaves.</p>

<p><a id="question_1278"></a>1278. <i>Why are the trunks of trees round?</i></p>

<p>Because, generally speaking, the leaves are distributed upon branches
around the trees in every direction. They consequently send down the
wood-forming principle on all sides. When a trunk is unduly developed
on one side, it may generally be traced to the unequal distribution
of the branches.</p>

<p><a id="question_1279"></a>1279. <i>What are exogenous stems?</i></p>

<p>Exogenous stems are those that grow by the addition of wood <i>on their
outer surface</i>, underneath the bark.</p>

<p><a id="question_1280"></a>1280. <i>What are endogenous stems?</i></p>

<p>Endogenous stems are those that <i>grow inwardly</i>, from the centre.
Trees of this class, of which palms are the best example, are almost
peculiar to tropical climates.</p>

<p><a id="question_1281"></a>1281. <i>Why do endogenous stems chiefly abound in tropical climates?</i></p>

<p>Because, probably, the excessive heat of those climates would
interfere with the <i>formation of wood from the sap</i> upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>outer
surface.</p>

<p>The vascular structure of endogenous stems lying more abundantly
towards their centre, tends to <i>conserve the juices</i> which in hot
climates are so highly valued. Palm-wine is a delicious and cooling
beverage, and is procured from various kinds of palms, but especially
from the cocoa-nut palm. Even the fresh sap is very refreshing.
The juice is procured by cutting the tree in the upper part, and
attaching a vessel to the opening, to receive the sap. Its flow is
increased by cutting off a slice of the wood daily.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p><a id="question_1282"></a>1282. <i>Why have endogenous stems no bark?</i></p>

<p>Because, one of the chief functions of the bark in exogenous trees,
is to <i>protect the sap</i> from which the wood is formed on the outward
surface; and as there is no such external flow of sap in endogenous
trees, the bark is <i>unnecessary to them</i>, and is therefore withheld.
They are furnished instead with a thin cuticle.</p>

<p><a id="question_1283"></a>1283. <i>Why do endogenous stems grow to a great height?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the stem grows from the centre, it soon reaches that
limit of diameter <i>which its vascular structure is calculated to
support</i>;
 and, therefore, the wood-forming sap is deposited chiefly
at the top of the stem, causing it to grow to a considerable height.</p>

<p><a id="question_1284"></a>1284. <i>Why do the various vegetable fruits ripen in succession?</i></p>

<p>Because the Author of Nature has thus arranged its economy, <i>in order

Some vegetable productions arrive at their perfection in the spring;
others in summer; and others in autumn. Among the latter are many
that require to come slowly to maturity after they are gathered; by
these the winter season is provided for, and a surplus of the winter
stock goes to supply the natural deficiency of spring.</p>

<p><a id="question_1285"></a>1285. <i>Why, when seeds are sown, and germination begins, does the
leaf-germ seek the light, and the root-germ grow down into the earth?</i></p>

<p>Because the Creator has endowed every single seed with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> <i>vital
instinct which governs its development</i>. The rootlet could more
easily grow upward than downward, because of the looser earth, and
of the exciting influences of light and moisture. Yet it takes
the contrary course, leaving the leaf-germ to come up to meet the
sun-light, and to send down to the stem and roots, the matter needed
for their growth.</p>

<p>Frequently, indeed, when seeds are thrown into the earth, their
natural position is reversed, and when the germs first start from
the seed, the <i>root-germ</i> is directed <i>upward</i> and the <i>leaf-germ
downward</i>. What then occurs? They each turn, and, in doing so,
frequently cross each other. Each goes to its particular duty&mdash;the
duty that God appointed.</p>

<p><a id="question_1286"></a>1286. <i>Why are the seeds of plants indigestible?</i></p>

<p>Because they are encased in a hard covering upon which the gastric
juice of animals takes no effect. This provision has been made by the
Creator, <i>for the preservation of seeds</i>, the productions of which
are so essential to animal life.</p>

<p>The gastric juice can dissolve any other part of the plant, even
the woody fibre, and yet upon the <i>seed</i> it takes no effect. When,
however, the seed is <i>crushed</i>, and, thereby, the vital principle
destroyed, so that no plant can spring from it, the gastric juice
acts upon it, and it is soon dissolved.</p>

<p>Hence graminivorous birds are provided with gizzards <i>to break the
protecting coats of the grain</i>;
 and animals that feed on seeds and
nuts <i>strip them of their shells and husks</i>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that in the <i>succulent fruits</i>, such as the
strawberry, the raspberry, currant, apple, orange, melon, &amp;c., and
which, from their very nature, are likely to attract animals to use
them, and in eating which <i>the seeds are likely to be swallowed</i>,
they are fortified by a doubly-protective coating; the pips of the
apple, orange, &amp;c., and the seeds of the strawberry and raspberry,
pass through the digestive organs, not only unharmed, but their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
germinating powers are even improved by the warmth and trituration of
the stomach. Indeed, the stomachs of quadrupeds and birds have been
made the vehicles of propagating plants, and distributing them to the
widest geographical latitudes. It is even said of some seeds that
they will not germinate until they have passed through the digestive
organs of an animal.</p>

<p><a id="question_1291"></a>1291. <i>Why do caterpillars pass into the state of the chrysalis?</i></p>

<p>Because they are thereby prepared for the new existence which they
are about to enjoy; <i>new organs must be perfected in them</i> to adapt
them to the altered conditions of their lives.</p>

<p>Because, also, in the transformation of their bodies, differing
materially from the laws of existence that pertain to other
creatures, the Creator affords another illustration of his
Omnipotence.</p>

<p>Because, also, during the stage that the insect sleeps in the
chrysalis, the flowers and their sweet juices, upon, which the fly
is to feed, are being prepared for it, just as, when it was sleeping
in the egg, the green food was being prepared for the caterpillar.
When, therefore, the beautiful fly spreads its silken wings, it finds
a <i>second time</i> that, while it has slept, its meal has been prepared,
and it now flies away joyously to feed upon the milk and honey of
beautiful flowers which, at the time it passed into the chrysalis,
had not yet unfolded their petals.</p>

<p>Paley observes, that "the <i>metamorphosis</i> of insects from grubs into
moths and flies, is an astonishing process. A hairy caterpillar
is transformed into a butterfly. Observe the change. We have four
beautiful wings where there were none before; a tubular proboscis, in
the place of a mouth with jaws and teeth; six long legs, instead of
fourteen feet. In another case, we see a white, smooth, soft worm,
turned into a black, hard, crustaceous beetle, with gauze wings.
These, as I said, are astonishing processes, and must require, as it
should seem, a proportionably artificial apparatus. The hypothesis
which appears to me most probable, is that, in the grub, there exists
at the same time three animals, one within another, all nourished
by the same digestion, and by a communicating circulation; but
in different stages of maturity. The latest discoveries made by
naturalists, seem to favour this supposition. The insect, already
equipped with wings, is descried under the membranes both of the worm
and nymph. In some species, the proboscis, the antennæ, the limbs,
and wings of the fly, have been observed to be folded up within the
body of the caterpillar; and with such nicety as to occupy a small
space only under the two first wings. This being so, the outermost
animal, which, besides its own proper character, serves as an
integument to the other two, being the farthest advanced, dies, as we
suppose, and drops off first. The second, the pupa or chrysalis, then
offers itself to observation. This also, in its turn, dies; its dead
and brittle husk falls to pieces, and makes way for the appearance
of the fly or moth. Now, if this be the case, or indeed whatever
explication be adopted, we have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> prospective contrivance of the
most curious kind; we have organisations <i>three deep</i>;
 yet a vascular
system, which supplies nutrition, growth, and life, to all of them
together."</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p>Lord Brougham, in a note upon the above, does not support Paley's
view. He says "It is more than probable that the parts which are to
appear in the perfect insect do <i>not</i> exist in the larvæ, where there
is not much difference between the larva and pupa, excepting at the
time just previous to its becoming a pupa, at which time the larva is
motionless and torpid. The caterpillar of a moth, when about to turn
into a pupa, provides for the protection of the latter state, either
by surrounding itself with a web, or by some other means. Soon after
this is accomplished, the caterpillar becomes motionless, or nearly
so; it can neither eat nor crawl. At this time, and <i>not before</i>, the
parts of the pupa are forming within the skin of the caterpillar,
which may be easily seen by dissection."</p>

<p>It appears to the author, however, that Paley is partially right, and
Lord Brougham totally wrong, in these remarks. When Lord Brougham
asserts that the parts of the pupa are forming within the skin of
the caterpillar at that time when the transformation begins, "and
not before, which may be easily seen by dissection," he forgets,
that although in some instances it is the first moment when, to the
human eye, the organs of the new creature <i>become perceptible</i>, that
the "<i>three deep</i>" nature which Paley attributes to the <i>grub</i>, must
really have existed <i>in the egg</i>&mdash;that the <i>butterfly</i> originated <i>in
the egg</i>, as certainly as did the <i>caterpillar</i>, or the <i>chrysalis</i>,
and that unless that egg had possessed its three mysterious embryos,
it would have been impossible for the grub to have progressed to
the stages of transformation. No one has ever known the embryo of a
bird's egg to pass through three distinct and dissimilar states of
existence; nor has any one ever known the embryo of the butterfly's
egg to stop short at either of the stages, if the proper conditions
of its existence and development were supplied to it. <i>Why?</i> Because
the embryo of the insect has a <i>threefold</i> nature, while that of the
bird is <i>single</i>.</p>

<p><a id="question_1292"></a>1292. <i>Why does the caterpillar become torpid when passing into the
state of the chrysalis?</i></p>

<p>Because in all probability, where the difference between the first
and the ultimate form is considerable, the organs of the insect
having to undergo great changes, it would suffer considerable pain.
Torpor comes upon the insect, it is thrown into a state similar to
that of a person who has inhaled chloroform; and after what has, in
all probability, proved a pleasant dream, the insect awakes to find
itself changed and beautified.</p>

<p><a id="question_1293"></a>1293. <i>Why are the pupæ of grasshoppers and other insects, when about
to undergo transformation, still active and sensitive?</i></p>

<p>Because, as there is but a <i>slight difference</i> between the form which
they have in the pupa state, and that which they ultimately assume,
they do not require the state of torpidity to save them from pain,
nor to arrest their movements while their organs are being changed.
With them <i>the outer skin is thrown off</i>, and they are then perfect
insects.</p>

<p><a id="question_1294"></a>1294. <i>Why do caterpillars, when about to pass through the chrysalis
state, attach themselves to the leaves of plants, &amp;c.?</i></p>

<p>Because they know instinctively that for a time they will be <i>unable
to controul their own movements, and to avoid danger</i>. They therefore
choose secure and dry places, underneath leaves, or in the crevices
of old and dry walls, and there they firmly attach themselves, to
await the time of their liberation.</p>

<p><a id="question_1295"></a>1295. <i>Why do insects attach their eggs, to leaves &amp;c.?</i></p>

<p>Because, as the eggs have to be preserved during the winter, the
insect attaches them to some surface which will be a <i>protection to
them</i>. Generally speaking, the eggs are attached to the permanent
stems of plants, and not to those leafy portions which are liable to
fall and decay. The spider <i>weaves a silken bag</i> in which it deposits
its eggs, and then it hangs the bag in a sheltered situation. Nature
keeps her butterflies, moths, and caterpillars, locked up during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
the winter, in their egg-state; and we have to admire the various
devices to which, if we may so speak, the same nature has resorted
for the <i>security</i> of the egg. Many insects enclose their eggs in a
silken web; others cover them with a coat of hair, torn from their
own bodies; some glue them together; and others, like the moth of the
silk-worm, glue them to the leaves upon which they are deposited,
that they may not be shaken off by the wind, or washed away by rain;
some again make incisions into leaves, and hide an egg in each
incision; whilst some envelope their eggs with a soft substance,
which forms the first aliment of the young animal; and some again
make a hole in the earth, and, having stored it with a quantity of
proper food, deposit their eggs in it.</p>

<p><a id="question_1297"></a>1297. <i>Why do moths fly by night?</i></p>

<p>Because they are <i>organised to enjoy subdued light</i> and cool air; and
as they take very little food during the short life they have in the
winged state, they find sufficient by night. Some of the moths, like
that of the silk-worm, take no food from the time they escape from
the chrysalis until they die.</p>

<p>Because, also, they form the food of bats, owls, and other of the
night-flying tribes.</p>

<p><a id="question_1298"></a>1298. <i>Why are the bodies of moths generally covered with a very
thick down?</i></p>

<p>Because, as they fly by night, they are liable to the effects of cold
and damp. The moths, therefore, are nearly all of them covered with
a very thick down, quite distinguishable from the lighter down of
butterflies.</p>

<p><a id="question_1299"></a>1299. <i>Why do moths fly against the candle flame?</i></p>

<p>Because their eyes are organised <i>to bear only a small amount of
light</i>. When, therefore, they come within the light of a candle,
their sight is overpowered and their vision confused; and as they
cannot distinguish objects, they pursue the light itself, and fly
against the flame.</p>

<p><a id="question_1300"></a>1300. <i>Why do insects multiply so numerously?</i></p>

<p>Because they form the food of larger animals, and especially of
birds. A single pair of sparrows and a nest of young ones have been
estimated to consume upwards of <i>three thousand</i> insects in a week.</p>

<p><a id="question_1301"></a>1301. <i>Why does the "death-watch" make a ticking noise?</i></p>

<p>Because the insect is one of the beetle tribe, having a horny case
upon its head, <i>with which it taps upon any hard substance</i>, the
ticking is the call of the insect to its species, just as the noise
made by the cricket is a note of communication with other crickets.</p>

<p class="bq">There is a superstition connected with the death-watch,
which, like most superstitions, is based upon the theory of
<i>probabilities</i>. The death-watch is usually heard in the spring
of the year, and a superstition runs to the effect that some one
in the house will die before the year has ended. Persons who are
superstitious are never very strict in the interpretation of
their predictions; and therefore, whether a person dies in the
house or out of it, in the same room where the death-watch was
heard, or across the wide Atlantic, so that there be some kind
of relationship, or even acquaintance, between the person who
hears the omen, and the person dying, the event is sure to be
connected with the prophetic sounds of the death-watch. Little
weens the small timber-boring beetle, when he is tapping gently
to call his mate, and perhaps peeping into every corner and
crevice to find her, that he is sending dismay into the heart of
some superstitious listener, who, in ignorance of a simple fact,
overwhelms herself with an imaginary grief.</p>

<p><a id="question_1302"></a>1302. <i>Why are insects in the first stage, after leaving the egg,
said to be in the "larva" state?</i></p>

<p>Because the term larva is derived from the Latin <i>larvated</i>, meaning
masked, clothed as with a mask; the term is meant to express that the

<p><a id="question_1303"></a>1303. <i>Why are insects in the second state said to be in the "pupa"

that in which it was the fashion of the ancients to <i>bandage their

<p><a id="question_1304"></a>1304. <i>Why are insects in the "pupa" stage also called "chrysalides?"</i></p>

a fancied resemblance to the <i>nymphs of the heathen mythology</i>. The
nymphs were supposed goddesses of the mountains, forests, meadows,
and waters.</p>

<p class="bq">This term has generally, but very improperly, been also applied to
the pupa state, so that <i>pupa</i>, <i>chrysalis</i>, and <i>nymph</i> have all
been employed to represent one state. This is obviously an error,
as there is nothing in the condition of the <i>pupa</i> or <i>chrysalis</i>
that can at all accord with the mythological idea of a <i>nymph</i>,
and which, in reference to the beautiful and joyous fly, finds a
much truer application.</p>

<p>Because the insect, having no other limbs, is provided with those
projecting members, the lower two serving as <i>feelers</i> and the upper
two also as <i>feelers</i> and <i>eyes</i>. These, projecting in the front of
the animal, impart to it a consciousness of surrounding objects, and
especially of those which lie in its path.</p>

<p><a id="question_1310"></a>1310. <i>Why is the snail able to move, without feet?</i></p>

<p>Because it has attached to its body a fringe of muscular skin,
which is capable of considerable contraction and expansion, and by
alternately stretching and shortening this, the snail is able to draw
himself along.</p>

<p><a id="question_1311"></a>1311. <i>Why do we see no snails in the winter time?</i></p>

<p>Because they bury themselves in the ground, or in holes, where they
remain <i>in a torpid state</i> for several months. Before they enter into
the torpid state, they form with their slimy secretion, and with some
earthy matters which they collect, a strong cement with which they
seal up the opening to their shells.</p>

<p><a id="question_1312"></a>1312. <i>Why can snails live in shells thus sealed?</i></p>

<p>Because they leave, in the thin wall by which they close themselves

in sufficient air to carry on their feeble respiration during their
winter sleep.</p>

<p><a id="question_1313"></a>1313. <i>Why do insects abound in putrid waters, and in decaying
substances?</i></p>

<p>Because they have been endowed with appetites and with constitutions
that enable them to live upon and to enjoy corrupt matter. In this
point of view the maggots of flies are exceedingly useful; a dead
carcass is speedily threaded by them in every direction; thus that
corrupt matter which, in a large mass, would poison the air, is
taken up in small portions by millions of living bodies, and by them
<i>dispersed</i>, and becomes innoxious.</p>

<p>Because, as their formation becomes perfected, and the fluids of
the body of the pupa become absorbed in the production of the light
texture of the wings, &amp;c., <i>the body and its case become lighter than
the water</i>, and rise and float upon the surface. The pupa-case then
forms a natural boat, from which the fly emerges, and spreading its
wings, enters upon the final state of its existence.</p>

<p class="bq">The <i>elytra</i>, or scaly wings of the genus of scarabæus, or beetle,
furnish an example of this kind. The true wing of the animal is
a light, transparent membrane, finer than the finest gauze, and
not unlike it. It is also, when expanded, in proportion to the
size of the animal, very large. In order to protect this delicate
structure, and, perhaps, also to preserve it in a due state of
suppleness and humidity, a strong, hard case is given to it,
in the shape of the horny wing which we call the elytron. When
the animal is at rest, the gauze wings lie folded up under this
impenetrable shield. When the beetle prepares for flying, he
raises the integument, and spreads out his thin membrane to the
air. And it cannot be observed without admiration, what a tissue
of cordage, <i>i. e.</i> of muscular tendons, must run in various and
complicated, but determinate directions, along this fine surface,
in order to enable the animal, either to gather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
it up into a
certain precise form, whenever it desires to place its wings under
the shelter which nature hath given to them, or to expand again
their folds when wanted for action.</p>

<p class="bq">In some insects, the elytra cover the whole body; in others, half;
in others only a small part of it; but in all, they completely
hide and cover the true wings. Also,</p>

<p class="bq">Many, or most of the beetle species lodge in holes in the earth,
environed by hard, rough substances, and have frequently to
squeeze their way through narrow passages; in which situation,
wings so tender, and so large, could scarcely have escaped injury,
without both a firm covering to defend them, and the capacity of
folding themselves up under its protection.</p>

<p><a id="question_1321"></a>1321. <i>Why have many of the beetle tribe large strong horns?</i></p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1326"></a>1326. The distribution of animals, or <i>Zoological Geography</i>, is of
great interest, and should be carefully studied in connection with
<i>Botanical Geography</i> (<i>see</i> <a href="#question_1208">1208</a>). The highest department of the
animal kingdom (writes the Rev. W. Milner) commences with the class of
<i>Birds</i>, which may be naturally divided into the three great orders
of ærial, terrestrial, and aquatic. Aggregation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> into immense flocks
is a distinguishing feature of several species,
especially of the
aquatic order, which form separate colonies, building their nests in
the same state, though other spots equally adapted are at no great
distance. Hence the Vogel-bergs, or bird rocks of the northern seas,
one of which at Westmannsharn in the Faroe group of islands, seldom
intruded upon by man, presents a most extraordinary spectacle to the
visitor. The Vogel-berg lies in a frightful chasm in the precipitous
shores of the island, which rise to the height of a thousand feet,
only accessible from the sea by a narrow passage. Here congregate a
host of birds. Thousands of guillemots and auks swim in groups
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>around
the boat which conveys man to their domain, look curiously at
him, and
vanish beneath the water to rise in his immediate neighbourhood. The
black guillemot comes close to the very oars. The seal stretches his
head above the waves, not comprehending what has disturbed the repose
of his asylum, while the rapacious skua pursues the puffin and gull.
High in the air the birds seem like bees clustering about the rocks,
whilst lower they fly past so close that they might be knocked down
with a stick. But not less strange is the domicile of this colony.
On some low rocks scarcely projecting above the water sit the glossy
cormorants, turning their long necks on every side. Next are the skua
gulls, regarded with an anxious eye by the kittiwakes above. Nest
follows nest in crowded rows along the whole breadth of the rock, and
nothing is visible but the heads of the mothers and the white rocks
between. A little higher on the narrow shelves sit the guillemots and
auks, arranged as on parade, with their white breasts to the sea, and
so close that a hailstone could not pass between them. The puffins take
the highest station, and, though scarcely visible, betray themselves
by their flying backwards and forwards. The noise of such a multitude
of birds is confounding, and in vain a person asks a question of his
nearest neighbour. The harsh tones of the kittiwakes are heard above
the whole, the intervals being filled with the monotonous note of the
auk, and the softer voice of the guillemot. When Graba, from whose
travels this description is principally drawn, visited the Vogel-berg,
he was tempted by the sight of a crested cormorant to fire a gun, but
what became of it, he remarks, it was impossible to ascertain. The air
was darkened by the birds roused from their repose. Thousands hastened
out of the chasm with a frightful noise, and spread themselves over
the ocean. The puffins came wandering from their holes, and regarded
the universal confusion with comic gestures. The kittiwakes remained
composedly in their nests, whilst the cormorants tumbled headlong into
the sea. Similar great congregations of the feathered race appear where
the shores are rocky high, and precipitous, but this is strikingly the
case, where</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1327"></a>1327. Most terrestrial birds, unacquainted with man, exhibit a
remarkable tameness, and are slow in acquiring a dread of him, even
after repeated lessons that danger is to be apprehended from his
neighbourhood. Mr. Darwin speaks of a gun as almost superfluous in
the unfrequented districts of South America, for with its muzzle
he pushed a hawk off the branch of a tree. Once, while lying down,
a mocking thrush alighted on the edge of a pitcher, made of the
shell of a tortoise, which he was holding in his hand, and began
very leisurely to sip the water, even allowing him to handle it
while seated on the vessel. In Charles Island, which had been
colonised about six years, he saw a boy sitting by a well with a
switch in his hand, with which he killed the doves and finches
as they came to drink; and for some time had been constantly in
the habit of waiting by the well for the same purpose, to provide
himself with his dinners. In the Falkland Islands, at Bourbon, and
at Tristan d'Acunha, the same tameness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> was noticed by the early
visitors. On the other hand, the small
 birds in the arctic regions
of America, which have never been persecuted, exhibit the anomalous
fact of great wildness. From a review of various facts, Mr. Darwin
concludes, "first, that the wildness of birds with regard to man is
a particular instinct directed against him, and not dependent on
any general degree of caution arising from other sources of danger;
secondly, that it is not acquired by individual birds in a short
time, even when much persecuted; but that in the course of successive
generations it becomes hereditary. Comparatively few young birds in
any one year have been injured by man in England, yet almost all,
even nestlings, are afraid of him; many individuals, however, both at
the Galapagos and at the Falklands, have been pursued and injured by
man, but yet have not learned a salutary dread of him."</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1328"></a>1328. Numerous species of birds may be regarded as the favourites of
nature on account of the gracefulness given to their shape, and the
richly-coloured plumage with which they are adorned, as evidenced in
the gaudy liveries of many of the parrot tribe, and the forms and
hues of the birds of paradise. But they are especially interesting
to man for the faculty of song with which they are endowed; in some,
"most musical, most melancholy," in others, sprightly and animating,
inspiriting the sons of toil under the burdens peculiar to their
station. It deserves to be remarked, as an instance of compensation
and adjustment, that whilst the birds of the temperate zone are far
inferior to those of tropical climes in point of beauty, they have
far more melodious notes in connection with their less attractive
appearance.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1329"></a>1329. From the powerful means of locomotion possessed by several of
the bird tribe, and their great specific levity, air being admitted
to the whole organisation as water to a sponge, it might be inferred,
that the entire atmosphere was intended to be their domain, so that
no species would be limited to a particular region. The common
crow flies at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour; the rapidity
of the eider-duck, <i>Anas mollissima</i>, is equal to ninety miles an
hour; while the swifts and hawks travel at the astonishing speed of
a hundred and fifty miles in the same time. It is true that some
species have a very extensive range, as the nightingale, the common
wild goose, and several of the vulture tribe. The same kind of osprey
or fishing-eagle that wanders along the Scottish shores appears upon
those of the south of Europe, and of New Holland. The lammergeyer
haunts the heights of the Pyrenees, the mountains of Abyssinia, and
the Mongolian steppes; and the penguin falcon occurs in Greenland,
Europe, America, and Australia. In general, however, like plants
and terrestrial quadrupeds, the birds are subject to geographical
laws, definite limits circumscribing particular groups. The common
grouse of our own country affords a striking exemplification of this
arrangement, as it is nowhere met with out of Great Britain; and
other examples occur of a very scanty area containing a species not
to be found in any other region. The celebrated birds of paradise we
exclusively confined to a small part of the torrid zone, embracing
New Guinea and the contiguous islands; and the beautiful Lories
are inhabitants of the same districts, being quite unknown to the
New World. Parroquets are chiefly occupants of a zone extending a
few degrees beyond each tropic, but the American group is quite
distinct from the African, and neither of these have one in common
with the parrots of India. The great eagle is limited to the highest
summits of the Alps; and the condor, which soars above the peak of
the loftiest of the Andes, never quits that chain. Humming-birds
are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
entirely limited to the western hemisphere, where a particular
species is sometimes bounded by the range of an island, while others
are more extensively spread, the <i>Trochilus flammifrons</i>, common to
Lima, being observed by Captain King upon the coast of the Straits
of Magellan, in the depth of winter, sucking the flowers of a large
fuchsia, then in bloom in the midst of a shower of snow. Among the
birds incapable of flight, which rival the quadrupeds in their
size, the intertropical countries of the globe have their distinct
species, presenting similar general features of organisation, as the
ostrich of Africa and Arabia, the cassowary of Java and Australia,
and the touyou of Brazil. In the arctic regions, we meet with
species peculiar to them, the <i>Strix laeponicus</i> or Lapland owl,
and the eider-duck, an inhabitant of the shores, from whose nests
the eider-down is obtained. Several families of maritime birds are
likewise limited to particular oceanic localities. Approaching the
fortieth parallel of latitude, the albatross is seen flitting along
the surface of the waves, and soon afterwards the frigate and other
tropical birds appear, which never wander far beyond the torrid zone.
It thus appears, that, notwithstanding the great locomotive powers of
birds, particular groups have had certain regions assigned to them
as their sphere of existence, which they are adapted to occupy, and
to which they adhere in the main, though it is easy to conceive of
natural causes occasionally constraining to a migration into new and
even distant territories. Captain Smyth informed Mr. Lyell, that when
engaged in his survey of the Mediterranean, he encountered a gale
in the Gulf of Lyons, at the distance of between twenty and thirty
leagues from the coast of France, which bore along many land-birds
of various species, some of which alighted on the ship, while others
were thrown with violence against the sails. In this manner, many an
islet in the deep, after ages of solitude and silence, uninterrupted
except by the wave's wild dash, and the wind's fierce howl, may have
received the song of birds, forced by the tempest from their home,
and compelled to seek a new one under its direction.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1330"></a>1330. There is no feature more remarkable in the economy of birds
than the periodical migrations, so systematically conducted, in
which five-sixths of the whole feathered population engage. In the
case of North America, according to an estimate by Dr. Richardson,
the passenger-pigeons form themselves into vast flocks for the
journey, one of which has been calculated to include 2,230,000,000
individuals. We are familiar with the cuckoo as our visitor in
spring, and with the house-swallow as our guest through the summer,
the latter usually departing in October to the warmer regions of
the south, wintering in Africa, returning again when a more genial
season revives its insect food. By cutting off two claws from the
feet of a certain number of swallows, Dr. Jenner ascertained the
fact of the same individuals re-appearing in their old haunts in the
following year, and one was met with even after the lapse of seven
years. The arctic birds migrate farther south, when the seas, lakes,
and rivers become covered with unbroken sheets of ice; the swans,
geese, ducks, divers, and coots flying off in regular phalanxes to
regions where a less rigorous winter allows of access to the means
of life. Hence, soon after, we lose the swallows, we gain the snipes
and other waders, which have fled from the hard frozen north to our
partially frozen morasses, where their ordinary nutriment may still
be obtained. The equinoctial zone, where the seasonal change is that
of humidity and drought furnishes an example of the same phenomenon.
As soon as the Orinoco is swollen by the rains, overflows its banks,
and inundates the country on either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
side, an innumerable quantity of
aquatics leave its course for the West India islands on the north,
and the valley of the Amazon on the south, the increased depth of the
river, and the flooded state of the shores, depriving them of the
usual supply of fish and insects. Upon the stream decreasing, and
retiring within its bed, the birds return.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1331"></a>1331. A comparison between the quadrupeds of the Old and New Worlds
is in every point strikingly in favour of the former. Not only has
the western continent no animals of such giant bulk as those of
the eastern, but no examples of such high organisation, such power
and courage, as the African lion and the Asiatic tiger display.
Buffon's remark must indeed be considerably modified, respecting the
cowardice of the American feline race; for the jaguar of the woods
about the Amazon, when attacked by man, will not hesitate to accept
his challenge, will even become the assailant, nor shrink from an
encounter against the greatest odds. The following passages from the
writings of Humboldt show that this transatlantic animal is not to be
despised:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"The night was gloomy; the Devil's Wall and its denticulated rocks
appeared from time to time at a distance, illuminated by the burning
of the savannahs, or wrapped in ruddy smoke. At the spot where
the bushes were the thickest, our horses were frightened by the
yell of an animal that seemed to follow us closely. It was a large
jaguar, that had roamed for three years among these mountains. He
had constantly escaped the pursuit of the boldest hunters, and had
carried off horses and mules from the midst of enclosures; but,
having no want of food, had <i>not yet</i> attacked men. The negro who
conducted us uttered wild cries. He thought he should frighten the
jaguar; but these means were of course without effect. The jaguar,
like the wolf of Europe, follows travellers even when he will not
attack them; the wolf in the open fields and in unsheltered places,
the jaguar skirting the road, and appearing only at intervals between
the bushes."</p>

<p class="bq">The same illustrious observer also remarks,&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"Near the Joval, nature assumes an awful and savage aspect. We there
saw the largest jaguar we had ever met with. The natives themselves
were astonished at its prodigious length, which surpassed that of all
the tigers of India I had seen in the collections of Europe."</p>

<p class="bq">Still these were extraordinary specimens of the race, and leave the
fact undoubted, that the most formidable of the western <i>Feræ</i> has
no pretensions to an equality with his congener, the tyrant of the
jungles of Bengal.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1332"></a>1332. In vain also we look among the tribes of America for a rival
in outward appearance to the giraffe, so remarkable for its height,
its swan-like neck, gentle habits, and soft expressive eye; while
of the animals most serviceable to mankind&mdash;the horse, the ox, the
ass, the goat, and the hog&mdash;not a living example of either was known
there before its occupancy by the Europeans. But, however inferior
the animal race of the New may be as compared to those of the Old
world, the balance between the two appears to have been pretty equal
in remote ages; geological discovery has disproved the assertion of
Buffon, that the creative force in America in relation to quadrupeds
never possessed great vigour, and has established the fact, that
it is only the more recent specimens of its energy that are upon
an inferior scale. The relics of the unwieldly magatherium, of the
gigantic sloth, and armadillo-like animals, discovered in great
abundance imbedded in its soil, prove that at a former period it
swarmed with monsters of equal bulk with those that now roam in the
midst of Africa and Asia. The estuary deposit that forms the plains
westward of Buenos Ayres, and covers the gigantic rocks of the Bando
Oriental, appears to be the grave of extinct gigantic quadrupeds.</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1333"></a>1333. There are various animals which are very widely dispersed,
enduring the extremes of tropical heat and of polar cold, which are
either in a wild condition or in a state of domestication. Wild
races, considered to be varieties of the domestic dog, occur in
India, Sumatra, Australia, Beloochistan, Natolia, Nubia, various
parts of Africa, and both the Americas; while in subjection to
man, the dog is his faithful companion, and has followed his steps
into every diversity of climate and of situation to which he has
wandered. The north temperate zone of the Old Continent appears to
be the native region of the ox, which passes in Lapland within the
arctic circle, and has been spread over South America since its first
introduction by the Spaniards. The horse, originally an inhabitant
of the temperate parts of the Old World, has shared in a similar
dispersion, and now exists in the high latitude of Iceland, in the
desolate regions of Patagonia, and roams wild in immense herds over
the Llanos of the Orinoco, leading a painful and restless life in the
burning climate of the tropics. Humboldt draws a striking picture of
the sufferings of these gifts of the Old World to the New, returned
to a savage state in their western location.</p>

<p class="bq">"In the rainy season, the horses that wander in the savannah, and
have not time to reach the rising grounds of the Llanos, perish
by hundreds amidst the overflowings of the rivers. The mares are
seen, followed by their colts, swimming, during a part of the day,
to feed upon grass, the tops of which alone wave above the waters.
In this state they are pursued by the crocodiles; and it is by no
means uncommon to find the prints of the teeth of these carnivorous
reptiles on their thighs. Pressed alternately by excess of drought
and of humidity, they sometimes seek a pool, in the midst of a bare
and dusty soil, to quench their thirst; and at other times flee
from water and the overflowing rivers, as menaced by an enemy that
encounters them in every direction. Harassed during the day by
gad-flies and mosquitoes, the horses, mules, and cows find themselves
attacked at night by enormous bats, that fasten on their backs, and
cause wounds which become dangerous, because they are filled with
acaridæ and other hurtful insects. In the time of great drought,
the mules gnaw even the thorny melocactus (melon-thistle), in order
to drink its cooling juice, and draw it forth as from a vegetable
fountain. During the great inundations, these same animals lead
an amphibious life, surrounded by crocodiles water-serpents, and
manatees. Yet, such are the immutable laws of nature, their races
are preserved in the struggle with the elements, and amid so many
sufferings and dangers. When the waters retire, and the rivers return
into their beds, the Savannah is spread over with a fine odoriferous
grass; and the animals of old Europe and Upper Asia seem to enjoy, as
in their native climates the renewed vegetation of spring."</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1334"></a>1334. The first colonists of La Plata landed with seventy-two horses,
in the year 1535, when, owing to a temporary desertion of the colony,
the animals ran wild; and in 1580, only forty-five years afterwards,
it had reached the Straits of Magellan. The ass has a more restricted
range than the horse, not being capable of enduring so great a
degree of cold, though usually far from being considered a delicate
animal. To the warmer parts of the temperate zone, between the 20th
and the 40th parallels of latitude, the ass seems best adapted, not
propagating much beyond the 60th, and only occurring in a state of
degeneration beyond the 52nd. The sheep and goat tribe are widely
spread, equally supporting the extremes of temperature. According to
Zimmerman, the <i>Argali</i> or <i>Mouflon</i>, the original race of sheep,
still exists on all the great mountains of the two continents; and
the <i>Capricorn</i> and <i>Ibex</i>, the ancestors of the common goat inhabit
the high European elevations. From the 64th degree of north latitude
the hog is met with all over the old continent, and also in the
islands of the Indian Ocean, peopled by the Malay race; and since its
introduction into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
New World, it has diffused itself over it,
from the 50th parallel north as far as Patagonia. Originally the cat
was not known in America, nor in any part of Oceanica; but it has now
spread into almost every country of the globe. Among animals entirely
wild, the most extensively diffused, are the fox, hare, squirrel, and
ermine; but the species are different in every region of the world;
nor is there perhaps one example to be found of a species perfectly
identical naturally existing in distant localities of the earth.</p>

<p class="center bq">"His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from
the heat thereof."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm xix.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">Respecting the <i>internal constitution and heat of the earth</i>,
differences of opinion, and some very wild speculation have existed.
We find in Humboldt's "Cosmos" the following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1335"></a>1335. "It has been computed at what depths liquid and even gaseous
substances, from the pressure of their own superimposed strata, would
attain a density exceeding that of platinum, or of iridium; and in
order to bring the actual degree of ellipticity, which was known
within very narrow limits, into harmony with the hypothesis of the
infinite compressibility of matter, Leslie conceived the interior of
the Earth to be a hollow sphere, filled with "an imponderable fluid
of enormous expansive force." Such rash and arbitrary conjectures
have given rise, in wholly unscientific circles, to still more
fantastic notions. The hollow sphere has been peopled with plants and
animals, on which two small subterranean revolving planets, Pluto and
Proserpine, were supposed to shed a mild light. A constantly uniform
temperature is supposed to prevail in these inner regions, and the
air being rendered self-luminous by compression, might well render
the planets of this lower world unnecessary. Near the north pole, in
82 deg. of latitude, an enormous opening is imagined, from which the
polar light visible in Aurora streams forth, and by which a descent
into the hollow sphere may be made. Sir Humphry Davy and myself were
repeatedly and publicly invited by Captain Symmes to undertake this
subterranean expedition; so powerful is the morbid inclination of
men to fill unseen spaces with shapes of wonder, regardless of the
counter-evidence of well-established facts, or universally recognised
natural laws. Even the celebrated Halley, at the end of the 17th
century, hollowed out the earth in his magnetic speculations; a
freely rotating subterranean nucleus was supposed to occasion, by its
varying positions, the diurnal and annual changes of the magnetic
declination. It has been attempted in our own day, in tedious
earnest, to invest with a scientific garb that which, in the pages of
the ingenious Holberg, was an amusing fiction."</p>

<p class="bq">The following are among the speculations which Humboldt thus severely
but justly condemns:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq">"The increase of temperature observed is about 1 deg. Fahr. for every
fifteen yards of descent. In all probability, however, the increase
will be found to be in a geometrical progression as investigation is
extended; in which case the present crust will be found to be much
thinner than we have calculated it to be. And should this be found
to be correct, the igneous theory will become a subject of much more
importance, in a geological point of view, than we are at present
disposed to consider it. Taking, then, as correct, the present
observed rate of increase, the temperature would be as follows:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="ml-30">Water will boil at the depth of 2,430 yards.<br />
Lead melts at the depth of 8,400 yards.<br />
There is red heat at the depth of 7 miles.<br />
Gold melts at 21 miles.<br />
Cast iron at 74 miles.<br />
Soft iron at 97 miles.</p>
</div>

<p class="bq">And at the depth of 100 miles there is a temperature equal to the
greatest artificial heat yet observed; a temperature capable of
fusing platina, porcelain, and indeed every refractory substance we
are acquainted with. These temperatures are calculated from Guyton
Morveau's corrected scale of Wedgwood's pyrometer; and if we adopt
them, we find that the earth is fluid at the depth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> of 100 miles from
the surface, and that even in its present state very little more than
the soil on which we tread is fit for the habitation of organised
beings."</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"He hath filled the hungry with good things; and
the rich he hath sent empty away."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke i.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">The above is to be found in Mr. Timbs's "Things not Generally Known,"
a little book which professes to set people right upon points on
which they are in error!</p>

<p class="bq">Upon this subject Mr. Hunt, in his "Poetry of Science," says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1336"></a>1336. "A question of great interest, in a scientific point of view,
is the temperature of the centre of the earth. We are, of course,
without the means of solving this problem; but we advance a little
way onwards in the inquiry by a careful examination of subterranean
temperature at such depths as the enterprise of man enables us to
reach. These researches show us, that where the mean temperature of
the climate is 50 deg., the temperature of the rock at 59 fathoms
from the surface is 60 deg.; at 132 fathoms it is 70 deg; at 239
fathoms it is 80 deg.; being an increase of 10 deg. at 59 fathoms
deep, or 1 deg. in 35.4 feet; of 10 deg. more at 73 fathoms deeper,
or 1 deg. in 43.8 feet; and of 10 deg. more at 114 fathoms still
deeper, or 1 deg. in 64.2 feet.</p>

<p class="bq">Although this would indicate an increase to a certain depth of about
one degree in every fifty feet, yet it would appear that the rate of
increase diminishes with the depth. It appears therefore probable,
that the heat of the earth, so far as man can examine it, is due to
the absorption of the solar rays by the surface. The evidences of
intense igneous action at a great depth cannot be denied, but the
doctrine of a cooling mass, and of the existence of an incandescent
mass, at the earth's centre, remains but one of those guesses which
active minds delight in."</p>

<p class="bq">Upon the subject of <i>hunger</i> and <i>thirst</i>, by which living creatures
are prompted to feast upon the bounties of nature, Sir Charles Bell
says, in "Appendix to Paley's Natural Theology:"&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1337"></a>1337. "Hunger is defined to be a peculiar sensation experienced
in the stomach from a deficiency of food. Such a definition does
not greatly differ from the notions of those who referred the
sense of hunger to the mechanical action of the surfaces of the
stomach upon each other, or to a threatening of chemical action
of the gastric juice on the stomach itself. But an empty stomach
does not cause hunger. On the contrary, the time when the meal
has passed the stomach is the best suited for exercise, and
when there is the greatest alacrity of spirits. The beast of
prey feeds at long intervals; the snake and other cold-blooded
animals take food after intervals of days or weeks. A horse, on
the contrary, is always feeding. His stomach, at most, contains
about four gallons, yet throw before him a truss of tares or
lucerne, and he will eat continually. The emptying of the
stomach cannot, therefore, be the cause of hunger.</p>

<p class="bq">"The natural appetite is a sensation related to the general
condition of the system, and not simply referable to the state
of the stomach; neither to its action, nor its emptiness, nor
the acidity of its contents; nor in a starved creature will a
full stomach satisfy the desire of food. Under the same impulse
which makes us swallow, the ruminating animal draws the morsel
from its own stomach.</p>

<p class="bq"><a id="question_1338"></a>1338. "Hunger is well illustrated by thirst. Suppose we take
the definition of thirst&mdash;that it is a sense of dryness and
constriction in the back part of the mouth and fauces; the
moistening of these parts will not allay thirst after much
fatigue or during fever. In making a long speech, if a man's
mouth is parched, and the dryness is merely from speaking,
it will be relieved by moistening, but if it comes from the
feverish anxiety and excitement attending a public exhibition,
his thirst will not be so removed. The question, as it regards
thirst, was brought to a demonstration by the following
circumstance. A man having a wound low down in his throat, was
tortured with thirst; but no quantity of fluid passing through
his mouth and gullet, and escaping by the wound, was found in
any degree to quench his thirst."</p>

<hr class="bible-verse" />
<p class="center bq">"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter;
Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
man."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes xii.</span></p>
<hr class="bible-verse" />

<p class="bq">"Thirst, then, like hunger, has relation to the general
condition of the animal system&mdash;to the necessity for fluid in
the circulation. For this reason, a man dying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> from loss of
blood suffers under intolerable thirst. In both thirst and
hunger, the supply is obtained through the gratification of an
appetite; and as to these appetites, it will be acknowledged
that the pleasures resulting from them far exceed the pains.
They gently solicit for the wants of the body; they are the
perpetual motive and spring to action."</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Our task draws near to a conclusion; and we hope that those who have
followed our teachings will thirst after further knowledge; that they
will henceforward regard the great Book of Nature as the work of an
Almighty Hand, and endeavour to find, for everything that Nature
does, the <i>Reason Why</i>.</p>

<p>A high perception of the wisdom of the Divine Being, must necessarily
be the result of an intelligent contemplation of the Divine works. To
the ignorant, the name of God is an unmeaning word; it may inspire
fear, but it does not develope love. To the dark mind of the untaught
man, God is no more than one of those mysterious existences that awe
the superstitious, and deter the wicked. There is no grafting of
the soul of the man upon the eternal love. But knowledge brings man
into communion with that Almighty wisdom which is the fountain of
all truth and happiness. To the enlightened man, God is the sun of
all goodness, around whom the attributes of Power, Wisdom, and Love,
radiate and fill the universe. As man's physical eye cannot withstand
the light of the sun, neither can man's spiritual eye see the whole
glory of God. But as we can rejoice in the sunshine, and interpret
the mission of the sunbeam, so can we find happiness in the Divine
presence, and gather wisdom by the contemplation of the Creator's
works.</p>

<p>Nature is a great teacher. What a lesson may be gathered from the
germination of a seed; how uniformly the germs obey their destiny.
However carelessly a seed may be set in the ground, the germ which
forms the root, and that which is the architect of the stem, will
seek their way&mdash;the one to light, the other to darkness&mdash;to fulfil
their duty. The obstruction of granite rocks, cannot force the
rootlet upward, nor drive the leaflet down. They may kill the germs
by exhausting their vital powers in an endeavour to find the proper
elements; but no obstruction can make a single blade of grass do
aught but strive to fulfil the end for which it was created. Would
that man were equally true to the purpose of his existence, and
suffered neither the rocks of selfishness, nor the false light of
temptation, to force or allure him from duty to his God.</p>

<p>"Live and Learn" is a most useful book, designed as a Guide to Grammar,
Composition, and Punctuation. So few people speak or write really good
grammar, and fewer still punctuate decently, that a book that informs
them how to do so&mdash;and not only that indicates their faults, but shows
them how they are to be corrected&mdash;cannot fail to be popular; <i>there is
not a person indeed, who might not learn something from it</i>.</p>

<p>No work heretofore written on this subject contains one half the really
useful information that the present does. It should be in the hand of
every man, woman and child in the country, and is alike invaluable to
the Scholar, the Merchant, the Farmer, and the Artizan.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of persons engaged in professional and commercial
pursuits, who are sensible of their deficiencies on many points
connected with the grammar of their own tongue, and who, by
self-tuition, are anxious to correct such deficiencies, and to acquire
the means of speaking and writing, if not with elegance at least with
a due regard to grammatical accuracy, to whom this little work is
"indispensible." As a book of reference, "Live and Learn" will settle
many disputes. It ought to be on every table, and be particularly
recommended to the young, before habit makes common blunders uncommon
hard to cure.</p>


<p class="center p1">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"Live and Learn" is an excellent book. To show our appreciation of
its merits we have had it cased in leather, and have made a pocket
companion of it. We look upon it as really <i>indispensible</i>. We advise
our readers to imitate our example&mdash;procure the book and sell it not
for any price&mdash;<i>Educational Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>Such a book as this has long been wanted by those who entertain the
wish alluded to in the title. It is suitable for all classes. We have
attentively conned its pages, and can <i>recommend it as one of the best
works of reference for the young student, or even the ripe scholar, and
as deserving to be generally consulted. The work is altogether useful
and indispensible.&mdash;New York Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>This book, particularly intended as <i>a</i> work of reference for the
solution of difficulties connected with grammar, composition and
punctuation, etc., etc., will be found useful by those who have not
received a sound elementary education and who nevertheless move in
position.&mdash;<i>Daily Times</i>.</p>

<p>This capital work not only gives examples of over 1000 mistakes, but
it gives rules for their correction so clear, so terse, and at once
so simple that the most ordinary mind cannot fail to comprehend their
meaning. This is one of the chief beauties of "Live and Learn," for
what is the use of pointing out a grammatical error without giving a
key to its correction? There has been several catchpenny works on this
subject lately issued. They tell the reader that mistakes exist, but
give no rule for their avoidance. If you want a really good work, buy
"Live and Learn."</p>

<p>This is a goodly sized volume of 356 pages, comprising a sort of
Encyclopedia of Scientific Information of all kinds. It is arranged
with an Alphabetical Index, in referring to which you can solve almost
any problem in Natural Philosophy or Learned Science that may come up.
It is a book that will give you the cream of the information that a
long course of practical experiments and profound study has imparted to
the <i>savants</i> and philosophers of this progressive age. It contains a
collection and solution of Thirteen Hundred &amp; Thirty-Two Facts in
Science &amp; Philosophy, some of which, on their first discovery, puzzled the most learned and
apt scholars.</p>

<p>It is useless to go into details of this excellent work. Suffice it to
say, that it treats on every imaginable subject pertaining to Causes
and Effects, and must necessarily be invaluable to all persons who
desire KNOWLEDGE, and whose means and position in life have prevented
them from acquiring it by a regular and tedious course of Study.</p>

<p>We hesitate not to say, that any one who closely reads this volume
will obtain as much real learning in a few days as years of study and
patient research would afford them in a regular course. In a word it
makes you a learned and refined person with spending but very little
money, time or trouble.</p>

<p>No pains have been spared by the Author to make this a popular book, in
fact a book for the million, and some idea may be formed of its vast
usefulness when we inform the reader that THE REASON WHY has an
Index of Contents requiring Forty Columns of Fine Type.</p>

<p>No person who desires to figure in refined and intelligent circles
should delay purchasing a copy of this capital work, for it will
furnish thousands of ideas and important topics of conversation, so
that the most ignorant person by reading it will be posted up on all
scientific subjects.</p>

<p>What Haydn's Dictionary of Dates is in regard to historical events,
this wonderful book is in respect to scientific facts. The plan of the
book and its execution, leave nothing to be desired. We can cordially
recommend this work to all those inquirers, young and old, of both
sexes, who are never satisfied until they know the "reason why."</p>

<p>"The writings of Judge Haliburton have long been regarded as the
production of the finest humorist that has ever attempted the

chronicles the last experiences of Sam Slick."&mdash;<i>Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

There are plenty of other books containing Crochet patterns, but the

much felt and glaring deficiency, and has the terms in Crochet so

<p class="center">A Religions Novel. Royal 12mo., cloth. 534 pages. Price $1 25.</p>

<p>This work has received favorable notice from the entire secular as
well as the religious press. The main design of the author in the
illustration of the fact that success in business may easily consort
with fervid piety and the strictest honesty on the part of those
engaged in it. The story is that of a young man, the son of a country
pastor, who goes as an assistant into a dry goods store, at New York;
and not only maintains his religious principles amidst the allurements
of the capital, but succeeds in drawing within their happy influence
a number of the clerks and other assistants, who at first scoffed at
his "rural piety," as they termed it, but were at length led by him
to abandon the frivolities which had formed their former delight, and
devote themselves to religious exercises and the visitation of the sick
and poor. His influence reached even a higher circle; and the author
gives us some lively sketches of the insipidity and heartlessness of
fashionable life, whose unhappy devotees choose to live for society and
self, rather than for Religion and their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>&#8258; The Publishers have in their possession,
testimonials from over <i>three hundred</i> of the principal Clergymen in
the United States and Canada, pronouncing this to be the best work
that has been published for years, and in every instance they are the
honest convictions formed after an actual perusal of the volume itself.
This work has also received high laudation from almost every paper of
character and standing in this country. Added to which it has been read
by thousands, and has received universal commendation.</p>

<p>Na Motu is the quaint title of a handsome volume of voyage and
adventure in the South Seas. Mr. Perkins, the author, a schoolmate
of Ike Marvel, has spent several years before the mast, and on the
salt water in other capacities, and his style is characterized by a
straightforward, honest nonchalance and idiomatic flavor, redolent of
Old Ocean from stem to stern. His daguerreotype of nautical dialogues
is only a little too perfect, occasionally, for good taste; a large
portion of his experience being gained on a whaling ship.&mdash;<i>New York

<p>* * * * "Fun has no limits. It is like the human race and face; there

combinations produce new varieties. A man who has an eye for fun sees
it in everything. * * * There is a work called 'The Horse,' and another
'The Cow,' and 'The Dog,' and so on; why should'nt there be one on 'The
Galls?' They are about the most difficult to choose and to manage of
any created critter, and yet there aint any dependable directions about
pickin' and choosin' of them. Is it any wonder then so many fellows get
taken in when they go for to swap hearts with them? Besides; any one
can find a gentleman that keeps a livery stable to get him a horse to
order, but who can say, 'This is the Gall for your money!'"</p>

<p>"We have perused this work with some attention, and do not hesitate to
pronounce it one of the very best productions of the talented author.
There is not a page that does not glow with thrilling and interesting
incident, and will well repay the reader for the time occupied in
perusing it. The characters are most admirably drawn, and are perfectly
natural throughout. We have derived so much gratification from the
perusal of this charming novel, that we are anxious to make our readers
share it with us: and, at the same time, to recommend it to be read
by all persons who are fond of romantic adventures. Mr. Bennett is a
spirited and vigorous writer, and his works deserve to be generally
read; not only because they are well written, but that they are, in
most part, taken from events connected with the history of our own
country, from which much valuable information is derived, and should,
therefore, have a double claim upon our preference, over those works
where the incidents are gleaned from the romantic legends of old
castles and foreign climes."&mdash;<i>Louisville Journal.</i></p>

alludes to this circumstance by way of apology, in the preface
to "Temper." We predict for them a wide spread popularity. They
are original in style, truly moral and religious in tone, and are
calculated to accomplish much good, as the author aims some telling
blows at the tendency of the present generation towards <i>Infidelity</i>,

spirit. The tale is, indeed, "sad, high and working; full of state and

earnestness with which it is related, will at once communicate itself

<p class="center font-larger">TIT FOR TAT;</p>

<p class="center">A NOVEL,</p>

<p class="center">BY A LADY OF NEW ORLEANS.</p>

<p class="center">12mo. Cloth, Price $1. Sent free of postage.</p>

<p>This the title of a most wonderful book, written by a lady of New
Orleans, and issued from the press for the perusal of all persons whose
minds have been poisoned by the pernicious exaggerations of American
life and Negro Slavery to be found in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and "Dred."
The lady of New Orleans has done her work manfully. The book shows
clearly that those who cry out against Negro Slavery, and utter the
rankest falsehoods about that institution, are the supporters and
proprietors of a system of <i>white</i> slavery more cruel and debasing in
its character and operations than the most skilful romancist could
imagine. All this is shown in a Tale abounding with spirited and
dramatic scenes and incidents. "TIT FOR TAT" embraces forty chapters
of astonishing interest. MILLIONS of copies of this work should be
circulated.</p>


<p class="center p1">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>"It recounts, in a forcible manner, the evils of the English social
system.... We only wish it furnished any sufficient apology for our
shortcomings."&mdash;<i>Commercial, Buffalo.</i></p>

<p>"One of the must powerfully written novels of the day."&mdash;<i>Springfield
Republican.</i></p>

<p>"It is a poem in all its parts; fervid, womanly and
eloquent."&mdash;<i>Galveston News.</i></p>

<p>"She shows clearly that those who cry out against Negro Slavery
are the supporters of a system of white Slavery, most cruel and
depraved."&mdash;<i>Savannah News.</i></p>

<p>This is "carrying the war into Africa" with a vengeance. It is more
than "a Roland for an Oliver." It is more caustic than even "Change
for Dickens' American Notes. By a lady." "Dred, a Tale of the Dismal
Swamp," the offspring of foreign influence; British influence;
subsidising and Anglicising the Yankee pen of Harriet Beecher Stowe, is
answered most effectually in a tale of white slavery, far more dismal
than all the caricatures that have ever been painted of Negro servitude
in the South. Our bane and antidote are both before us. "Tit for Tat"
is confined to England and the English, and is, therefore, a more
direct and appropriate reply to the Duchess of Sutherland's minion. The
bold, startling pictures are drawn from real life, and their darkest
shadows do not exaggerate the depths of degradation and misery into
which the fairest specimens of God's handiwork are plunged; white men
capable of appreciating misery in its highest forms, and of enjoying
all its benefits and refinements. And all the suffering and woe
depicted by the author with masculine vigor are the direct results of
the cruel oppression of the aristocracy, to whom Mrs. Stowe plays the
flunkey, flattering in their vices, the tyrants who wallow in luxury
upon the toil and blood of the people.&mdash;<i>New York Citizen.</i></p>
